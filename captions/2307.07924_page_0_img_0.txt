development, brings together
agents from diverse social identities, including chief officers, professional programmers, test engi-
neers, and art designers. When presented with a preliminary task by a human “client” (e.g., “develop a

through collaborative chatting. This process enables them to automatically craft comprehensive
software solutions that encompass source codes, environment dependencies, and user manuals.
