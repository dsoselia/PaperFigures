Saliency Map
Figure 3: The main results of our NEUROIMAGEN. The images positioned on the left with red boxes represent the ground truth
images. The second images from the left represent the pixel-level saliency map reconstructed from EEG signals. The three
images on the right exhibit the three sampling results for the given saliency map under the guidance of sample-level semantics.
with coarse-grained but accurate guidance of sample-level
semantics from EEG signals. The high-quality reconstructed
images purely from brain signals are perceptually and se-
mantically similar to the viewed images.

(Khare et al. 2022) on EEG-image dataset.
Comparison with Baselines
The quantitative results of NEUROIMAGEN and baselines
are listed in Table 1. We have introduced the IS reported
in the relevant literature, to exemplify the quality of the
reconstructed images. The IS is calculated by encompass-
ing all images reconstructed across all subjects and all
classes within the test set. As is demonstrated in Table 1,
the IS of our NEUROIMAGEN is significantly higher than
Brain2Image and NeuroVision. Furthermore, inspired by
(Bai et al. 2023), we provide a qualitative comparison with
the baselines in Figure 4. As can be seen, the quality of the
images reconstructed by our NEUROIMAGEN is markedly
higher than those reconstructed by the Brain2Image. This
observed enhancement serves to validate the effectiveness
and superiority of our proposed methodology.

Generation Consistency in Different Subjects
Since EEG signals are subject-specific cognitive processes
that differ significantly in different subjects. In this section,
we validate the robustness and feasibility of NEUROIMA-
GEN across different individuals. As is illustrated in Fig-
ure 5. The quantitative metric of different subjects are stable,
which proves the generalization ability of NEUROIMAGEN.
The qualitative results are shown in Figure 5. It can be seen
the sampling from different subjects are semantically similar
to the ground truth images.
Ablation Study
We further conduct experiments on the EEG-image dataset
to analyze the effectiveness of each module of our NEU-
ROIMAGEN. We define B and L as the sample-level seman-
tics from EEG signals using BLIP caption as supervision or
label caption as supervision. We define I as the pixel seman-
tics from EEG signals. The effectiveness of different meth-
ods is verified by employing ACC, IS, and SSIM.
