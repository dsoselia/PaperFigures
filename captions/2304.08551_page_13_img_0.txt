Fig. 6. Frame-by-frame view of music visualization by P10. Start and end prompts are displayed above the intervals. The first and last
images of each track correspond to these prompts. Intervals 1 and 3 show the design pattern of a hold. Intervals 1, 4, and 5 show color
and subject transitions.
“A lot of variation, especially with AI-generated music videos can make people feel crazy...[I am] trying
to keep to the philosophy of what a locked groove [techno musical phrase] is, making small variations
between the broader theme, from black and white to color. After four seconds, we should go from colored
disco to something else... Trying to create some visuals someone in a dance euphoria would see.” -P10
Participants were also able to create visual changes that aligned with musical change. For example, P8 created a
sharp visual change that aligned perfectly with the beginning of their melody. On the opening note of their melody,
the music visualization transitioned sharply from an image of sunlight over mountains to a cabin. We see another
example of audiovisual alignment when P2 generates a color transition in Figure 5 (second to last interval). This interval
captured a sudden drop and the beginning of a heavy metal breakdown. After the drop, the colors became dramatic and
psychedelic, reflecting the increased song intensity.
“The part where there’s a slide with the bass, I wanted that to be the transition... [the system] pretty
much got it... I want the intervals to start and end on beat.” -P4
