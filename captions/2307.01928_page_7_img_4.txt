or disposing of it in one of the bins. For the distribu-
tion of possible scenarios, we introduce new types of
ambiguities based on Winograd Schemas [18] (e.g.,
“There is an apple and bottled water on the counter...it
is rotten. Can you dispose of it?”), and ones that potentially involve unsafe actions (e.g., “place the bowl in
the microwave.”; there is a plastic bowl and a metal bowl, but only the plastic one is safe for the microwave).
This is a single-step setting with multiple acceptable options. In Table 2, we compare KNOWNO to Simple
Set again by first setting ϵ = 0.15 and also finding ϵ = 0.24 for Simple Set that achieves the same plan
success rate in simulation. The hardware experiment results again show that KNOWNO reduces the human
help rate by 14% and also reduces the average prediction set size.
Target success guarantee from KnowNo is robust to varying LLM choice.
We also run KNOWNO
with two other LLMs (without hardware evaluation). First, we use an instruction-finetuned version of
PaLM-2L (PaLM-2L-IF); there is no significant performance difference from PaLM-2L; however, it
