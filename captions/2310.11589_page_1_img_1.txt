I like reading science articles. 
I particularly enjoy articles 
about AI and outer space. 
Maybe some other areas of 
science as well. I don’t really 
enjoy reading about finance 
though, especially not whether 
the stock market is going up 
or down.

them?
I play tennis and yes I read a lot 
about it.
Do you like other sports?
I can’t think of any

Figure 1: Generative Active Task Elicitation (GATE) elicits user preferences through interactive, free-
form questions, which can then be used in downstream decision-making. Unlike non-interactive elicitation
approaches (e.g., prompting), which rely entirely on the human to elucidate their preferences, generative elic-
itation is better able to probe nuances of human preferences. Unlike active learning approaches, generative
elicitation can ask more generic, free-form questions. The three parts of this figure illustrate: (A) Fuzzy user
preferences: A user wishes to translate their fuzzy preferences for how a task should be performed into a speci-
fication for a machine learning model. This is challenging because users lack perfect introspection, preferences
can be difficult to specify in language, the specification needs to anticipate tricky real-world edge cases, and
models may misgeneralize from provided examples or instructions. (B) Task elicitation: We consider various
ways of eliciting these fuzzy preferences from users, including non-interactive prompting, active learning, and
generative elicitation (GATE). (C) Evaluation: We evaluate methods on a held-out test set, scoring how well a
language model predicted the true decisions made by the user.
