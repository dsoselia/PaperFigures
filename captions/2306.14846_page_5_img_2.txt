This allows adaptation to new tasks with minimal data, while still leveraging the performance and
generalization of ViNT. Appendix B.4 includes additional details.

Real-world Evaluation
We deployed our ViNT foundation model on five distinct robotic platforms, including a drone, a
quadruped, and two other novel robots which are not present in the training data. We designed our
experiments to answer the following questions:
Q1. Can ViNT efficiently explore previously unseen environments and incorporate heuristics?
Q2. Does ViNT generalize to novel robots, environments, and obstacles?
Q3. Can ViNT be fine-tuned to improve performance in out-of-distribution environments?
Q4. Can the ViNT policy be adapted to handle new task specification and modalities?
Please see Appendix D for more details on platforms used in the training data and in evaluation. We
did not perform any careful system identification or homogenization of sensors across the robots
