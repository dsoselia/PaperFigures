ChemCrow
Task input: 
Here is some chromophore data. 
• Clean the data. 
• Use only data with acetonitrile as solvent.
• Preprocess the data.
• Train a random forest model to predict               
  absorption max wavelength of molecules.
• Then make predictions for the molecules 
   in a selection pool.
• Finally, suggest a synthetic plan for the 
   one with wavelength closest to 369 nm. 
ChemCrow actions:
1. Check data rows to learn the format.
2. Filter data, solvent and relevant columns.
3. Calculate MorganFingerprints and
split dataset into train/test.
4. Train and evaluate random forest model.
5. Propose molecule(s) from the selection pool.
6. Predict 2 step synthetic procedure 
for selected molecule.
Human actions:
• Synthesize proposed molecule. 
• Conﬁrm product using  MS(ESI) and NMR.
• Analyse UV-Vis absorption spectrum.

absortion wavelenth closest to 369 nm. The 
root mean squared error of the random forest 
model is 37 nm.
