are uncertain about the appropriate plugins for their needs, we have incorporated a feature that
automatically selects the most relevant plugins based on their instructions. We posit that the plugin
agent can be instrumental in myriad scenarios, enriching various aspects of usersâ€™ daily lives. For a

We present the web agent as a specialized tool designed to enhance the capabilities of the chat
agent. The main interaction interface still lies with the chat agent, but when necessary, it seamlessly
involves the web agent. The web agent then delivers the final response to the user, as shown in
Figure 5. This design strategy is not just theoretical; it has been implemented and demonstrates
several notable advantages.
First, the chat agent systematically processes important parameters like user inquiries or initiating
URLs before transferring them to the web agent. This ensures that there is a strong alignment with
user intentions and facilitates clearer communication. To clarify further, when dealing with complex
tasks that may seem ambiguous or have multiple aspects, the chat agent uses a decompositional
approach. Herein, overarching directives from users are segmented into more digestible sub-tasks.
The chat agent then interfaces with the web agent using these sub-instructions, sequentially, ensuring
more granular and efficient problem resolution. Moreover, our configuration empowers a dynamic
interplay of multi-turn web navigation interspersed with chat dialogues, thereby accommodating
more layered and adaptable user queries. By distinctly demarcating the roles and responsibilities
of the web-browsing agent and the chat agent, we pave the way for the independent evolution and
continual refinement of each module. For a deeper dive into practical applications and the potential
of the web agent, we invite readers to peruse Appendix B.3.
