Step 4: Correction with human participation. After the above three steps, the TAM can now
successfully solve some common challenges and predict segmentation masks. However, we notice
that it is still difÔ¨Åcult to accurately distinguish the objects in some extremely challenging scenarios,
especially when processing long videos. Therefore, we propose to add human correction during
inference, which can bring a qualitative leap in performance with only very small human efforts. In
detail, users can compulsively stop the TAM process and correct the mask of the current frame with
positive and negative clicks.
