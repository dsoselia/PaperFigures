Figure 6: Grown Small-World network. In this experiment,
the NDP seeks to maximise the coefficients used to capture
the small-worldness criteria of a graph. Unlike the networks
grown to act as policies, this network is unweighted.
and two instantiations of it, one evolutionary based and one
gradient descent. We showed the feasibility of the approach
in continuous control problems and in growing topologies
with particular properties such as small-worldness. While
the approach is able to solve these simple domains, many
future work directions remain to be explored.
For example, the current NDP version does not in-
clude any activity-dependent growth, i.e. it will grow the
same network independently of the incoming activations that
the agent receives during its lifetime
However biologi-
