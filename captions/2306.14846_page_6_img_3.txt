Table 1: ViNT paired with our physical search algorithm consistently outperforms baselines for the task of
undirected goal-reaching in indoor and outdoor environments (left). By effectively planning over diffusion
subgoal proposals, ViNT is able to find an efficient path to the goal. Other baselines struggle to explore large
indoor environments, shown by trajectories overlaid on an indoor floor plan (right).
Figure 6: Visualizing ViNT exploration rollouts in challenging indoor environments using the Vizbot (top)
and LoCoBot (bottom) robotic platforms. Future action samples ˆa obtained by spatially grounding the subgoal
candidates are shown in yellow, with the best actions corresponding to the best candidate marked in blue.
