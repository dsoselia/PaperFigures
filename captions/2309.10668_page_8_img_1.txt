Figure 3 | Compression-based generation for text data. We condition gzip and Chinchilla on a context
text of size 1948 bytes (from enwik9) and then sample 100 bytes (𝐴��� tokens) autoregressively. Since
Chinchilla employs a tokenizer, the sampled sequences will contain 𝐴��� tokens, which do not necessarily
decode to 100 bytes. Chinchilla’s predictions are significantly more coherent than gzip’s.
