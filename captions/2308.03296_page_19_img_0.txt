Figure 4: Layerwise & tokenwise influence decomposition. We visualize the layerwise and
tokenwise influence decomposition (Equation 31) of the influential sequence for the shutdown query
(Figure 1). Layers are partitioned into 9 blocks and the sequence has 512 tokens. Red denotes
positive influence and teal denotes negative influence. The sum over layers/tokens allows us to
understand the tokenwise/layerwise influence distribution. The sum of the whole matrix approximates
the overall sequence influence estimate Ifpzmq.lii
