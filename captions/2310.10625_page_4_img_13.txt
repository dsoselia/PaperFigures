Table 1: Accuracy of Generated Video Plans. The percentage VLP and baselines are able to synthesize a full
video plan which can fully complete tasks in simulation and real environments. VLP substantially outperforms
both UniPi and directly combining the VLM policy
a low level control action u that makes progress towards xg. For each frame in our video plan x1:H,
the goal-conditioned policy is executed for a fixed pre-specified number of timesteps. We train πcontrol
using paired image and low level control snippets xi
1:T and ui
1:T , where we sample a random timestep
t, a corresponding state xt, and future state xt+h, and train πcontrol(xt, xt+h) to predict ut.i
