these experiments. We conducted normality assumption tests with a signiﬁcance level of α = 0.05 for GPT-3.5, and

the Shapiro-Wilk and Anderson-Darling tests resulted in a p-value greater than α, indicating that the data can be
assumed to be approximately normal. However, for GPT-4, the data is not normal but negatively skewed, indicating
that most scores are closer to the higher end and the maximum score. Since one dataset is assumed to be normally
distributed and the other is not, instead of a t-test, we used the Mann-Whitney U test (also known as the Wilcoxon
rank-sum test), which does not assume any particular distribution of the data. The result of the test showed a
p-value very close to zero (p-value = 2.2 × 10−16 < 0.05 = α), leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis, which
asserts that the medians of the two samples are identical. Figure 1 displays the histograms and box plots of the data
for GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. We can observe that the median score of GPT-4 is signiﬁcantly higher than that of GPT-3.5,
indicating that GPT-4 outperforms the previous version. It is worth noting that some of the questions on the exam
were referring to subjects discussed in the class, and that is why none of the samples obtained by GPT-4 could reach
the max score, which is 100%.
