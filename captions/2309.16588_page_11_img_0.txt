COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
Since our proposed fix introduces new tokens, it also increases the number of learnable parameters
and the FLOP count of the model. We show in Fig. 12 the relationship between number of registers
and increase in model FLOP count and parameter count. We observe that adding registers induces
a negligible change in number of parameters, and a slight change in FLOP count. Still, for n = 4
registers, the increase in FLOPs stays below 2%.
