Figure 1. Results and applications of IT3D. Top: high-resolution text-to-3D Refinement. IT3D can refine the texture and geometry
of 3D models generated by diffusion prior. Bottom: high-resolution prompt-based editing. Our method can edit 3D models given a
prompt. Naively editing 3D models by prompt replacement would potentially cause an editing failure.
and geometries. These inconsistencies pose a significant
barrier to traditional 3D reconstruction methods and hinder
them from producing satisfactory outcomes. To circumvent
this obstacle, we introduce a discriminator paired with an
ing and improving the overall quality of the generated 3D
objects.
Our method, termed IT3D, presents itself as a versa-
