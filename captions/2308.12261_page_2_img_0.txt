Dataset Retriever
Given a prompt, we first try to
discover existing manually-annotated data that can
support a userâ€™s task description. There are several
design decisions for the Dataset Retriever:
1 What datasets to search against?
could instead cover other model repositories such
as Model Zoo (Koh, 2020).
Training
Given retrieved and generated datasets
and a pretrained model, we use a Model Trainer
to finetune the model on a subset of the data. We
currently train models by treating all tasks as text-
to-text generation (Raffel et al 2020) as described
