This section introduces Meta-CoT, which is illustrated in Figure 4. On a high level, Meta-CoT
consists of three phases: (i) scenario identification: categorizes the scenario of the input question;
(ii) demonstration selection: fetches the ICL demonstrations for the categorized scenario; (iii)
answer derivation: performs the answer inference by feeding the LLM with the prompt comprising
the fetched ICL demonstrations and the input question. We detail these phrases as follows.

SCENARIO IDENTIFICATION
Given an input question qin, the goal of the scenario identification phase is to categorize the scenario,
e.g., the type of the question. To this end, we first prepare a few ICL demonstrations, each of which
consists of a question qi and its scenario si. The ICL demonstrations will be concatenated with
qin to prompt the LLM to infer the question scenario. At the very beginning, we leverage public
off-the-shelf datasets and obtain n data groups based on the <category, form > partitioning strategy
to construct the ICL demonstrations. Now that we have n data groups [D1, D2, . . . , Dn] as a mixed
questions pool MP, we randomly sample one question from each data group and obtain a set of
