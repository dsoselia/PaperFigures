domain. This suggests that while such personas may be a useful guide in some cases, they are not
yet sophisticated enough to stand in for real human participants. See Appendix D for more details.

ELICITING DESCRIPTIONS OF PREFERENCES
A fundamental challenge across many fields is how to obtain information about peopleâ€™s nebulous
thoughts, preferences, and goals. In psychology and cognitive science, protocol analysis describes
methods for how to obtaining and analyze verbal reports from subjects about cognitive processes
including via think-aloud protocols (Ericsson & Simon, 1980; Ericsson, 2017). In software usability
analysis, similar techniques are used to assess the usability and limitations of existing software
(Henderson et al., 1995), and for broader applications in the areas of survey, questionnaire, and focus
group design (Malhotra, 2006; Lietz, 2010; Krosnick, 2018; Krueger & Casey, 2002). High-quality
verbal reports can be challenging to obtain, however, and requirements elicitation studies methods
for gathering information even when it is challenging for users to fully understand or anticipate
their own needs or describe their preferences in clear, unambiguous language (Christel & Kang,
1992; Goguen & Linde, 1993; Coughlan & Macredie, 2002; Zowghi & Coulin, 2005; Pacheco et al.,
2018). In our work, we explore whether language models could take the place of human researchers
in surfacing these insights from people or even other language models.
