Figure 1: Architectural overview of FaceChain personalized portrait generation. During training, multiple data process-
ing approaches are adopted to generate tagged face images to train face-LoRA model online. The weights of face-LoRA
and style-LoRA models are then merged into foundation Stable-Diffusion model for text-to-image generation. The generated
portraits go through post-face-fusion and ranking before returning to users.
