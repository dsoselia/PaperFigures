ABSTRACT
Database administrators (DBAs) play a crucial role in managing,
maintaining and optimizing a database system to ensure data avail-
ability, performance, and reliability. However, it is hard and tedious
for DBAs to manage a large number of database instances (e.g., mil-
lions of instances on the cloud databases). Recently large language
models (LLMs) have shown great potential to understand valuable
documents and accordingly generate reasonable answers. Thus, we
propose D-Bot, a LLM-based database administrator that can con-
tinuously acquire database maintenance experience from textual
sources, and provide reasonable, well-founded, in-time diagnosis
and optimization advice for target databases. This paper presents a

Rewrite logical query …
Add lacking indexes …
Optimize query plan …
Thought: High memory usage seems to be caused by 
poor join performance and much inactive memory 
Reasoning: Poor joins can be solved by plan optimization
Action: optimize_query_plan
