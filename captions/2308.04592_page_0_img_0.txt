Abstract
As large language models improve, there is
increasing interest in techniques that leverage
these models’ capabilities to refine their own
outputs. In this work, we introduce Shepherd,
a language model specifically tuned to critique
model responses and suggest refinements, ex-
tending beyond the capabilities of an untuned
model to identify diverse errors and provide
suggestions to remedy them. At the core of
our approach is a high quality feedback dataset,
which we curate from community feedback and
human annotations. Even though Shepherd
is small (7B parameters), its critiques are ei-
ther equivalent or preferred to those from estab-
lished models including ChatGPT. Using GPT-
4 for evaluation, Shepherd reaches an average
What are some great financial investments with no risk at 
all?
Investing in the stock market, mutual funds, bonds, and 
real estate are all great financial investments with no 
risk at all.
The response is not accurate and does not address the 
question fully. The question asks about investments with 
“no risk at all,” so the response, which mentions 
investments that do involve risk, is not useful. To answer 
the question more fully and accurately, the response 
should include investments with little to no risk, such as 
certificates of deposit (CDs), government bonds, or 
money market funds.
What are the differences between plant-based and 
animal-based protein sources?
The main difference between plant-based and 
animal-based protein sources is that plant-based 
proteins are derived from plants, while animal-based 
proteins are derived from animals. Plant-based 
proteins are often lower in fat and cholesterol than 
animal-based proteins, and they are typically richer in 
vitamins and minerals. Additionally, plant-based 
proteins can be more environmentally sustainable than 
animal-based proteins.
