Figure 2: Detailed dataflow of the Reward Translator. A Motion Descriptor LLM takes the user input and describe
the user-specified motion in natural language, and a Reward Coder translates the motion into the reward parameters.
Inspired by recent progress on Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose to build the Reward Translator-
based on LLMs to map user interactions to reward functions corresponding to the desired robot motion. As
reward tuning is highly domain-specific and requires expert knowledge, it is unsurprising that LLMs trained
on generic language datasets (e g [1]) cannot directly generate a reward for a specific hardware Instead
