Figure 1: Architectural overview of FaceChain personalized portrait generation. During training, multiple data process-
ing approaches are adopted to generate tagged face images to train face-LoRA model online. The weights of face-LoRA
and style-LoRA models are then merged into foundation Stable-Diffusion model for text-to-image generation. The generated
portraits go through post-face-fusion and ranking before returning to users.

Skin Retouching. Since the skin quality of the images up-
loaded by users may be unpromising, we leverage the skin
retouching module to improve the skin quality of the face
images.
In particular, the Adaptive Blend Pyramid Net-
work [6] (ABPN) is used here for skin retouching, which
is available at https://modelscope cn/models/
• Tags specific to a given image, such as facial expres-
sions, jewelries and accessories, should be labeled ac-
curately to retain the relationship between salient im-
age features and the corresponding tags.
• Tags bound to human identities, such as eyes, lips and
ears, can be removed. Instead, the LoRA model can be
relied on to generate such features without any prompt
words.
• In general, using one tag to describe the overall charac-
teristics of the human identity works quite well in prac
