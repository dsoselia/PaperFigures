can create a visually appealing small game. This version surpasses the interface-less version in
terms of interactivity and user experience, providing a more enjoyable and engaging gameplay
environment. Furthermore, CHATDEV’s designer can assist the programmer in creating additional
graphics to enhance the GUI’s aesthetics and usability, without compromising its functionality. These
graphics, carefully crafted by the designer, contribute to making the GUI more visually pleasing and
user-friendly.
Additionally, if human users are unsatisfied with the images created by the art designer, they have
the flexibility to manually replace the original images after CHATDEV completes the software. This
allows for further customization according to users’ preferences, without affecting the software’s
core functionality. Users can tailor the visual elements to their liking, resulting in a personalized
software experience that aligns with their individual preferences.
For a more comprehensive understanding, we exemplify the dialogue processes that make program-
ming language choices in designing. More exemplary dialogues extracted from the chat chain of
the Gomoku game are shown in Appendix A, including the prompts we designed and the dialogue
process between agents at each phase. Please note that, due to space constraints, we only display key
information during the dialogue, omitting overly fine-grained details.

: To satisfy the new user’s demand and make a desktop application realizable,
you should propose a concrete programming language.
:
Python with the Pygame library is a suitable choice for implementing a
basic Gomoku game.
: Great! Python is a versatile and widely-used programming language that
will be suitable for implementing a basic Gomoku game. Its simplicity
and readability make it a popular choice for beginners and experienced
developers alike.
