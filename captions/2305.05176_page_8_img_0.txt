Figure 5: Accuracy and cost tradeoï¬€s achieved by FrugalGPT. Overall, FrugalGPT often achieves the
same performance of the best individual LLM API (e.g., GPT-4) with orders of magnitudes smaller
cost. When incurring the same cost, FrugalGPT can improves the accuracy by up to 5%. Examples of
LLM cascade for each dataset are shown on the right.
