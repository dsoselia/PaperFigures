Table 1: Statistics of code instruction data we consider. We display the number of programming
languages, total samples, and fraction of samples that contain code for permissive instruction datasets.
For finetuning on these datasets, we use small subsets with around 5,000 samples each.
languages during instruction tuning boosts their performance further. We hypothesize that code data
exhibits the same behavior. To improve performance on code-related tasks, we thus construct a code
