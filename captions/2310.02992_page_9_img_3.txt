CLIP space, we believe our model will push forward the transition from text-conditioned generation
toward vision-language generation, paving the way for numerous novel applications.

Conclusion
We propose KOSMOS-G, a model capable of high-fidelity zero-shot image generation from general-
ized vision-language input that spans multiple images. Our approach hinges on a unique "align before
instruct" pre-training strategy. KOSMOS-G demonstrates competitive single-entity subject-driven
image generation and text-to-image capability, it also stands as the first model to extend zero-shot
subject-driven image generation to multi-entity scenarios. Furthermore, KOSMOS-G allows seamless
replacement of CLIP, unlocking various new applications in conjunction with other U-Net techniques
such as ControlNet and LoRA. In general, we present KOSMOS-G as a preliminary effort aimed at
achieving the objective of “image as a foreign language in image generation.”
