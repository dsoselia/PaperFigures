2.1. Molecules in Cavities
The molecular Hamiltonian describes the vibrational modes as harmonic oscillators which are
coupled to each other by a third order anharmonic coupling term.
This term is obtained by
using a Taylor expansion of the the harmonic potential and therefore includes a mediator for the
IVR pathways in the model. So the molecular Hamiltonian for two separate modes (q, Q) in the
molecular part is described by:
ˆHmol = ¯hωq(ˆb†ˆb) + ¯hωQ(ˆc†ˆc) +
3
�
r,s
ηqQ
r,s
�
ˆb† + ˆb
�r �
ˆc† + ˆc
�s .
(2.3)
Here ωq describes the fundamental frequency of the molecular mode q which is coupled to the
cavity and the respective degrees of freedom are expressed with the ladder operators, ˆb† and ˆb.
In the second part, a lower energy vibrational mode Q is described with its respective frequency
ωQ and the corresponding ladder operators (ˆc†, ˆc). The last term describes the general form of
the third order couplings, where ηr,s describes the anharmonic coupling constants and will be
referred to by ˆW.[4] To obtain the corresponding eigenvector for the upper and lower polariton,
the Hamiltonian matrix is diagonalized. By doing this one arrives at the following expression for
the polaritons:[22, 25]
|ψ(UP,LP ); 0⟩ = |1c, 0, 0⟩ ± |0c, 1, 0⟩
√

.
(2.4)
Here the uncoupled states are described by the kets where the first term describes the excitation
in the cavity state, the second term describes the excitation in the high frequency mode and the
last term is the excitation in the Q mode.
2.1.2. Anharmonic Coupling Terms
Under specific symmetry considerations not all intramolecular coupling orders (r, s) are relevant.
In this specific case only orders with r + s ≤ 3 are considered. Since all considered coordinates are
intramolecular normal modes the bilinear coupling (1, 1) is in this case equal to zero. Generally, all
terms of the potential energy have to transform according to the totally symmetric representation
of the molecules point group.[26] Thus according to the following equation:
�
Γ(q)�r
×
�
Γ(Q)�s
⊂ ΓA.
(2.5)
Since the models discussed in this work modeled after the octahedral W(CO)6 molecule and
thus exhibit non-Abelian point group symmetry, the various possible couplings have
time-independent basis-set functions.

N1

j1=1
...
Nf

jf =1
Cj1...jf (t)

κ=1
χκ
jk (qκ)
(2.6)
Hereby, f represents the degrees of freedom (DOF), Cj1...jf (t) denotes the time-dependent
expansion coefficients and Nκ describes the number of basis functions used for representing the
κth DOF. The orthonormal time-independent primitive basis functions are represented by χκ
jk (qκ)
and only the time-dependent expansion coefficients are optimized variationally [31, 32].
The problem with the standard method is the exponential scaling as the number of coefficients
increase with N f. Therefore, the standard method is only suited for problems with less than 6
DOFs.
In the multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree method (MCTDH method) the scaling is
softened by introducing a smaller but now time-dependent basis, the so-called single particle func-
tions (SPFs)

(2.7)
The SPFs are represented as a linear combination of the time-independent primitive basis
functions. The ansatz for MCTDH method can now be written as the following:
Ψ (q1, ..., qf, t) =
n1

j1=1

jf =1
Aj1...jf (t)

κ=1

(2.9)
Where ΦJ describes the f-dimensional product of the SPFs, the Hartree product. The complex
expansion coefficients AJ and the basis functions φκ
jk (qκ, t) are both time-dependent and optimized
variationally [31, 32].
Due to the fact that a two layer scheme was used here (the time-dependent SPFs and the
primitive basis), the exponential scaling of the DOFs, as nk, is smaller compared to the one layer
method like the standard method.
By now applying the Dirac-Frenckle variational principle to the ansatz (eq. (2.9)), we obtain
the respective Equations of Motion and therefore a set of coupled differential
