Here ν1 = k1[H2], ν2 = k2[O2], ν3 = k3[H2], ν4 = k4[O2][M], and ν5 =
k5[CO]. Thus the exponential growth constant λ depends on the gas composi-
tion and the rate constants of reactions I to V. This paper reports measurements
on mixtures chosen to permit determinations of the rates of reactions I, II, III,
and V. Mixtures were selected by analyzing equation (1).
EXPERIMENTAL ASPECTS
Growth constants were obtained by measuring the blue carbon monoxide flame
band emission behind incident shocks. The intensity of this radiation is propor-
tional to the product of carbon monoxide and oxygen atom concentrations (ref.
3), and since very little carbon monoxide is consumed, the light monitors the
increase of oxygen atom concentration with time.
Gas mixtures contained varying amounts of hydrogen, carbon monoxide,
oxygen and in some mixtures carbon dioxide, diluted five to tenfold with argon.
Hydrogen, oxygen, and argon were high purity tank gases and were used without
further purification. Carbon monoxide was condensed at liquid nitrogen tem-
perature; about one-quarter of the condensate was pumped off and discarded.
Dry ice served as a convenient source of carbon dioxide.
It was purified by
sub-liming three-quarters of a sample into a liquid nitrogen cooled trap. The
first quarter of this trapped fraction was discarded and the middle half used for
mixture preparation.
Recently we showed that boundary layer effects must be considered in ana-
lyzing data obtained behind incident shocks; the growing boundary layer causes
increases in temperature, density, and residence time with increasing distance
behind the shock. Conditions behind the shocks, in the region of the experi-
mental measurements, were obtained from a computer program which integrated
the equations of chemical change for a shocked gas accounting for the effects of
boundary layer buildup. In general, the extent of chemical reaction was small,
and changes in gas properties were brought about largely by the gas dynamics
associated with boundary layer growth.
Exponential growth constants were obtained from plots of the logarithm of
observed light intensity against gas time; the relation between gas and labora-
tory times was obtained from the computer calculations.
SELECTION OF GAS MIXTURES
Let us turn now to the rationale used to select gas mixtures by analysis of
equation (1). To begin with, under our experimental conditions ν4 is gener-
ally small in comparison with the other ν′′s and can be neglected for purposes
of a qualitative discussion. Secondly, λ turns out to be a small positive root - of
the order of the smaller ν values and small compared with the larger ν values.
Thus, we neglect λ3 in comparison with the other terms and rewrite equation
(1):
[(ν1 + ν5) + ν2 + ν3] λ2 + ν3(ν1 + ν5)λ ∼= 2ν2ν3(ν1 + ν5)
If the amount of hydrogen in a mixture is large in comparison to oxygen, ν1
and ν3 are large and the term involving λ2 may be neglected; in this event,
λ ∼= 2ν2
On the other hand, if only a trace of hydrogen is present, ν3 is small, the
term involving λ may be neglected, and
λ2 ≃ 2ν2ν3(ν1 + ν5)
ν2 + (ν1 + ν5)
If we choose a mixture with a large amount of carbon monoxide, ν5 is large
and
λ ∼
√
2ν2ν3
Whereas if there is a large amount of oxygen, ν2 is large and

This, then, outlines a strategy for obtaining rates of reactions I, II, III, and
V. First, a mixture rich in hydrogen is used to determine k2. Next, with k2
known, a mixture with a trace of hydrogen and rich in carbon monoxide is used
to deter-mine k3. Finally, with k3 known, mixtures with excess oxygen and
varying pro
