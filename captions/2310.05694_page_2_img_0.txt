PLMs and LLMs, highlighting their differences. The training
and utilization of LLMs are described in Section IV. Evalua-
tion methods for LLMs are discussed in Section V. Section VI
focuses on the topics of fairness, accountability, transparency,
and ethics specifically related to Healthcare LLMs. Lastly,
Section VII provides the conclusion of the paper.
II. WHAT LLMS CAN DO FOR HEALTHCARE? FROM
FUNDAMENTAL TASKS TO ADVANCED APPLICATIONS
Numerous endeavors have been made to apply PLMs or
LLMs to Healthcare. In the early stages, the studies primar-
ily focused on fundamental tasks, including medical Named
Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Extraction (RE), Text
Classification (TC), and Semantic Textual Similarity (STS),
due to the challenges of accessing diverse medical datasets,
the complexity of the medical domain, and limitations of the
modelsâ€™ capabilities [30]. Recently, the concept of Artificial
General Intelligence (AGI) with Healthcare adaptation has
been proposed [31], [50], which has led to more practical
applications in various aspects of the Healthcare field. For
instance, some online medical consultation systems [51], [52]
more, some researchers explore the automatic generation of
multimodal medical reports [53], [54]. The overall application
framework of LLMs for Healthcare is shown in Figure 3. In
the following sections, we analyze what LLMs can do for
Healthcare in detail.
A. NER and RE for Healthcare
The initial step towards unlocking valuable information in
unstructured Healthcare text data involves performing NER
and RE. By extracting medical entities such as drugs, adverse
drug reactions, proteins, chemicals, as well as predicting
the relations between them, a multitude of useful functions
can be achieved, including but not limited to Adverse Drug
Event [55], Drug Drug Interaction [56], [57], and Chemistry
Protein Reaction [58]. These two tasks also provide fundamen-
tal information for a range of other Healthcare applications,
such as medical entity normalization and coreference [59],
[60], medical knowledge base and knowledge graph construc-
tion [25], [61], and entity-enhanced dialogue [62], [63]. For
example, by employing NER and RE tasks, the Healthcare
