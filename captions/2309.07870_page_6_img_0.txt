Deployment
Existing open-source frameworks for language agents focus on building proof-of-concept language
agents that run either in the terminal or on Gradio [Abid et al., 2019]. In contrast, AGENTS supports
deploying language agents as APIs with FastAPI5. This greatly facilitates developers to integrate
language agents in real-world applications.
3.6
The Agent Hub
AGENTS aims to not only facilitate the development, testing, and tuning of a language agents system
but also makes the distribution and sharing of language agents easier. To this end, we introduce
AGENT HUB, a platform that allows users to share their fine-tuned language agents as well as
search/download useful language agents that others share on the platform. In this way, one can easily
customize language agents by starting from community agents and slightly modifying them. This
greatly reduces the effort of designing, testing, and tuning language agents from scratch.

Automatic Creation of Agent Systems
While using an SOP to provide fine-grained control to language agents, it can sometimes be laborsome
for users to manually specify the SOP from scratch since it requires to set different states, their
connections, and the prompts and tools for each Component for all states. Therefore, we carefully
implement a pipeline for automatic SOP generation. Our SOP generation framework is based on
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) [Lewis et al., 2020]. The SOP generation pipeline itself is
also based on the AGENTS framework and has an SOP of first specifying the agents required, then
planning the states and their connections, and finally generating the Components. Therefore, this
pipeline can be regarded as a “meta agent” that can create other agents and multi-agent systems.
Detailed description of the automatic agent creation framework is decribed in [Zhou et al., 2023b].
