About the qualifications of Amazon Mechanical
Turk (MTurk) workers, we use the following qual-
ifications to recruit in total of 10 MTurk workers
with good track records: HIT approval rate greater
than or equal to 98%, number of HITs approved
greater than or equal to 500, and located in one
of the following English native-speaking countries:
Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom,
United States. Each annotator is limited to anno-
tating 10 examples, including both the output of
GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.
Annotators workers were compensated $7, cali-
brated to equal a $42/hour pay rate. We first anno-
tated examples in-house to determine the required
annotation speed. A summary block usually takes
around 10 minutes.
To demonstrate our annotation template and fa-
cilitate future research, we show the interface for
annotations.
