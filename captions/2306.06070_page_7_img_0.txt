have observed on other datasets. Further analysis reveals that one possible problem is the model’s
propensity to select the None option, asserting that the task cannot be finished on the current webpage.
This is somewhat accurate since tasks typically necessitate navigation through multiple webpages
and performing a series of actions before reaching the final result. This aspect indeed represents the
primary difficulty of our task. On the other hand, we observe highly promising outcomes with GPT-4.
The performance is on par with the tuned Flan-T5 models under Cross-Website and Cross-Domain
settings for element selection, indicating a great potential for developing generalist agents using
LLMs. Nevertheless, GPT-4’s high operational cost remains a concern. Developing smaller models
specialized for the web is an interesting future avenue.

Autonomous Agents for Web and Mobile Applications. Considerable initiatives have been in-
vested in automating web navigation, driven by a vision of facilitating effortless human-web interac-
tion. Yet, previous research has been limited by the types of tasks and websites it can handle, either
confined to simplified simulation environments [19, 28, 37], or limited to a narrow set of domains and
websites [36, 37]. Recent studies [3, 18, 32] have utilized similar techniques for mobile applications,
however, these are often simpler and offer fewer functions compared with full-fledged websites. In
contrast, MIND2WEB aims to adapt to a realistic web environment, characterized by its high diversity.
Also related is the research on web automation systems [1, 16]. These technologies often demand
programming skills, which can make them less accessible to general users. We aim to equip the web
automation system with a natural language interface, thereby reducing the entry barrier significantly.
