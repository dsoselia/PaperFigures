Figure 2. Pipeline of IT3D. Begin from a coarse 3D model, IT3D first generate a tiny posed dataset leveraging image-to-image pipeline
conditioning on rendering of the coarse 3D model. Then incorporate a randomly initialized discriminator to distill knowledge form the
generated dataset and update the 3D model with discrimination loss and SDS loss.
