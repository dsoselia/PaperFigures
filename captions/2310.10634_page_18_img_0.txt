Web Environment
We also explore the possibility of whether the web agent is capable of manipu-
lating real-world web navigation. We let the language agent control the web browser (Chrome in our
case) via the Chrome extension built by us and navigate on any websites accessible by the browser.
The extension can control the web page by performing actions such as clicking an element or typing
values into an element through Chrome Debugger 13. In this way, the web agent can act like a real
human user on the webpage, and the human can also interact with it anytime and continue to act on
the webpage. This environment makes the web navigation more real and visible and provides the
platform to build a generalist web assistant in the future. On the contrary, Browse with
Bing can
only act behind the screen and the navigation process actually occurs on the server side rather than
the client side, which significantly limits the function of web navigation and can hardly be seen,
controlled or taken over by the user. This makes it quite hard to build a web assistant that can help
users execute daily tasks on the userâ€™s computers, and enable more diverse scenarios for any website
in the wild unlike screenshotted or self-hosted ones (Shi et al., 2017; Yao et al., 2022a; Deng et al.,
2023; Zhou et al., 2023b). We also believe this feature can be beneficial to further research and
development in the automatic web agent area.
