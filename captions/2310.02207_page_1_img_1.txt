Figure 1: Spatial and temporal world models of Llama-2-70b. Each point corresponds to the layer
50 activations of the last token of a place (top) or event (bottom) projected on to a learned linear
probe direction. All points depicted are from the test set.
One possible explanation for our results is that the model only learns a mapping from place to a
