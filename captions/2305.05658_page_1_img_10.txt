tical in an autonomous setting. Other works
learn generic (non-personalized) rules about where
objects typically go inside a house by averag-
ing over many users (Taniguchi et al., 2021;
Kant et al., 2022; Sarch et al., 2022). Works
that focus on personalization aim to extrapolate
from a few user examples given similar choices
made by other users, using methods such as
collaborative filtering (Abdo et al., 2015), spa-
tial relationships (Kang et al., 2018), or learned
latent preference vectors (Kapelyukh and Johns,
2022). However, all of these approaches require
collecting large datasets with user preferences or
generating datasets from manually constructed,
simulated scenarios. Such datasets can be expen-
sive to acquire and may not generalize well if they
are too small.
Our approach is to utilize the summarization
Fig. 1 We study the task of household cleanup, where each
object on the floor must be picked up and put away while
following user preferences.
We investigate the proposed approach in a
real-world robotic mobile manipulation system
for household cleanup, which we call TidyBot
(Fig. 1). Before the robot begins cleanup, we ask
the user to provide a handful of example place-
