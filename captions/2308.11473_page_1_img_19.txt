Figure 1. Results and applications of IT3D. Top: high-resolution text-to-3D Refinement. IT3D can refine the texture and geometry
of 3D models generated by diffusion prior. Bottom: high-resolution prompt-based editing. Our method can edit 3D models given a
prompt. Naively editing 3D models by prompt replacement would potentially cause an editing failure.
and geometries. These inconsistencies pose a significant
barrier to traditional 3D reconstruction methods and hinder
them from producing satisfactory outcomes. To circumvent
this obstacle, we introduce a discriminator paired with an
adversarial loss to guide the learning of 3D models [3, 5].
Here, we treat the enhanced multi-view images generated
by I2I models as real data and the renderings of the op-
timized 3D models as fake data. By leveraging adversar-
ial losses, our model effectively addresses these multi-view
discrepancies, significantly enhancing the stability of train-
ing and improving the overall quality of the generated 3D
objects.
Our method, termed IT3D, presents itself as a versa-
tile plug-and-play solution, seamlessly integrating with any
text-to-3D methodology that draws upon 2D diffusion pri-
ors. Our method is versatile, supporting a range of 3D out-
put representations such as meshes and NeRFs. An addi-
tional advantage is its capacity to efficiently modify the ap-
pearance of 3D models using text, with examples illustrated
in Fig. 1. Empirical evaluations further reveal that our ap-
