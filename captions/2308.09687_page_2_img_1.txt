Reasoning Process
We model the reasoning process as a directed graph G =
(V, E); V is a set of vertices and E ⊆ V × V is a set of
edges. G is directed and thus the edges are a subset of or-
dered vertex pairs E ⊆ V × V . A vertex contains a solution
to a problem at-hand (be it an initial, intermediate, or a fi-
nal one). The concrete form of such a thought depends on
a use case; it could be a paragraph (in writing tasks) or a
sequence of numbers (in sorting) A directed edge (t1 t2)
