Figure 6: Samples from the model trained on CC12M at 10242 with progressive training.
Effects of nested levels Next, we compare the performance of using different number of nested
resolutions with experiments on CC12M. The result is shown in Fig. 8b. We see that increasing from
two resolution levels to three consistently improves the model’s convergence. It’s also worth noting
that increasing the number of nesting levels brings only negligible costs.
CLIP-FID trade-off Lastly, we show in Fig. 8c the pereto curve of CLIP-FID on the zero-shot
evaluation of COCO, achieved by varying the classifier free guidance (CFG) weight.
