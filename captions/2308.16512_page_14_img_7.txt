same random seed is used for each row for comparison. The three models from top to bottom are
trained with "3D data only", "2D + 3D data", and "2D + 3D data + 1,024 batch size".
from a severe Janus problem, partially due to imperfect camera annotations. The 2-view model
greatly reduces the multi-face problem, but it still could happen to some extent. Finally, the 4-view
model barely suffers from any multi-view consistency issues.

TRAINING WITH 2D DATA AND LARGE BATCH SIZE
Fig. (12) shows the qualitative comparison between training with and without 2D data for multi-view
diffusion model. Empirically, we found that adding the 2D data and increasing batch size has a
clear improvement for the model generalizability, leading to better image quality and text-image
correspondence.
