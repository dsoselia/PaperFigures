ALCUNA: Our Benchmark
With our proposed method, one can create a large
amount of new entities quickly based on exist-
ing structured knowledge. A natural attempt is
to construct new organisms on already discovered
ones, since the biological taxonomy is perfectly
adapted to our proposed approach Therefore we
