omy of the system, as it enables the object classi-
fier to work with a small set of generalized object
categories. The approach is (i) robust as there are
only a small number of categories to differentiate
between, and (ii) flexible because it supports arbi-
trary sets of object categories for different users. In
contrast, without LLM summarization, the object
classifier would have to be able to recognize all
possible fine-grained object classes, which is much
more difficult. Alternatively, the user would have
to manually specify the list of objects present in
each target scene, which would be impractical for
an autonomous system.
4 Experiments
of which has a set of objects, a set of recepta-
cles, a set of example “seen” object placements
(preferences), and a set of “unseen” evaluation
placements, all specified as text. The task is to
predict the placements in the “unseen” set given
the examples in the “seen” set.
The benchmark scenarios are defined in 4 room
types (living room, bedroom, kitchen, pantry
room), with 24 scenarios per room type. Each sce-
nario contains 2–5 receptacles (potential places
to put objects, such as shelves, cabinets, etc.),
4–10 “seen” example object placements provided
as input to the task, and an equal number of
“unseen” object placements (distinct from the
seen examples) provided for evaluation. There are
2 seen and 2 unseen object placements per recep-
