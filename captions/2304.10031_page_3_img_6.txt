Limited molecular representation: rings can only contain three atoms. (c) Triangular mesh of a protein surface. (d)
More flexible molecular representation, permitting the representation of any ring-shaped functional group. (e) Flexible
mesh which includes arbitrarily shaped faces. (f) Fully flexible molecular representation, permitting the representation
of the complex nested hierarchical structure characteristic of molecules and other natural systems. (g) Hierarchical
higher-order interactions in protein networks.

Terminology
Across discrete domains, we use the term cell to denote any node or relation between nodes such
as (hyper)edges, faces, or volumes. Cells possess two attributes: size—the number of cells it con-
tains—and rank—where nodes are said to have rank 0, edges and hyperedges rank 1, faces rank 2,
and so on. The part-whole relationships of simplicial and cellular complexes impose a relationship
between the rank of a cell and its size: cells of rank r contains exactly (resp. at least) r + 1 cells
of rank r − 1: faces (r = 2) contain exactly (resp. at least) three edges (r − 1 = 1). By contrast,
hypergraph cells do not encode part-whole relations and hyperedges may have any size. However,
hypergraph cells are limited to ranks 0 and 1. A combinatorial complex is unrestricted in both rank
and size: nodes have rank 0 and cells of any size > 1 can have any rank.
