kernel with smoothness parameter νl being 2l−1

and �L
l=1 wl = 1, wl ≥ 0. We randomly sample
Y from multivariate normal distribution with kernel function as the mixture kernel, Matérn with
ν = 1/2, 3/2, 5/2. The resulting sample paths are summarized in Figure 1.

Our results clearly indicate that the Matérn kernel with ν = 1/2 exhibits the least degree of
smoothness (continuous but not differentiable), and the smoothness increases with ν. The smoothness
of the mixture kernel is predominantly influenced by the Matérn kernel with ν = 1/2. When
comparing the sample path of the mixture kernel to those of the Matérn kernels with ν = 3/2 and
ν = 5/2, it is evident that the mixture kernel demonstrates a degree of smoothness similar to the
Matérn kernels with ν = 1/2.
To better demonstrate the smoothness of the mixture kernel and its least component, we further
examine the continuity and MSD of the mixture kernel and its mixing components empirically.
For a fixed x0 = 0, let xi = 1/i for i = 1, 2, . . . , and we generate yl
i from the GP, where
l = 1, . . . , T denotes the index of replicates. This allows us to approximate limx→0 E(f(x) − f(0))2

. The GP is mean-square
differentiable if and only if limi→∞ γi exists. Specifically, for the mixture of Matérn 1/2 and 3/2 and
Matérn 1/2, while βi → 0, γi does not converge (Figure 1 first two columns), which indicates that
both the mixture kernel and Matérn 1/2 are continuous but not differentiable. However, for Matérn
3/2 (Figure 1 third column), βi → 0 and γi converges, implying that Matérn 3/2 is continuous and
differentiable.
These empirical observations strongly support the claims made in Theorem 1, which suggests that
the inclusion of smoother kernel components in the mixture does not inherently enhance the overall
smoothness of the mixture kernel.

Simulation 2 - Univariate GP: Components with different smoothness
In the second simulation, our aim is to assess parameter identifiability in a GP with a mixture
kernel consisting of Matérn kernels with distinct smoothness. The mixture kernel is denoted as
K = �3
l=1 wlKl, where Kl is a Matérn kernel with parameters (σ2
l , αl, νl). For this simulation,
we set ν1 = 1/2, ν2 = 3/2, ν3 = 5/2. Theorem 2 indicates that the only identifiable parameter is
