Images and Prompts for DreamBench Evaluation
The input images selected for each entity for DreamBench evaluation are displayed in Figure 8. As
depicted in Table 3, We also slightly modified the original prompt to make it align better with the
training data. For the remaining prompt, we simply remove the prefix “a”. We observe the prefix will
slightly affect the performance of image editing or customized generation. This might be attributed
to the high frequency of captions starting with “a photo of” produced by BLIP-2 in our constructed
training data. Given that the compositional instruction tuning data does not contain too much editing
data when a prompt starts with a prefix like “a”, the model often refrains from altering the appearance
of the input image. This can be further refined by shifting the data paradigm or by fine-tuning the
alignment.
