Figure 1: A universal Simulator (UniSim). UniSim is a simulator of the real-world that learns from broad
data rich in different axes including objects, scenes, human activities, motions in navigation and manipulation,
panorama scans, and simulations and renderings.
divergence in information is natural and hard to overcome, posing difficulties to building a real-world
simulator that seeks to capture realistic experience of the world we live in.
In this work, we take the first steps towards building a universal simulator (UniSim) of real-world in-
teraction through generative modeling. Specifically, we propose to combine a wealth of data—ranging
from internet text-image pairs, to motion and action rich data from navigation, manipulation, human
activities, robotics, and data from simulations and renderings—in a conditional video generation
framework. With careful orchestration of data rich along different axes, we show that UniSim can
successfully merge the different axes of experience and generalize beyond the data, enabling rich
interaction through fine-grained motion control of otherwise static scenes and objects. In simulating
long-horizon interactions with UniSim, we develop a fundamental connection between autoregres-
sive video generation during inference and performing rollouts in a partially observable Markov
decision processes (POMDPs) [14, 15]. As a result, UniSim can simulate long-horizon interactions
consistently across video generation boundaries.
While the potential applications of UniSim are vast, we demonstrate a few practical use cases centered
around using simulated experience from UniSim. We first demonstrate how an embodied vision-
language planner can be trained to complete long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks through hindsight
relabeling of simulated experience [16] In addition to high level planning we further illustrate how
