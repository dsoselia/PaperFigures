Figure A9: Sample multiple choices generated with Attribute, Numeric, and Spatial ambiguities in Simulation.
Nonetheless, we hope to have future work looking into better training the model for proper uncertainty, and
then applying CP on top of it to achieve set-based calibration.
Low-level control success rate. KNOWNO translates the coverage guarantee from CP to task completion
guarantee leveraging human help. However, this relies on the low-level control working reliably. In
Simulation Tabletop Rearrangement, we find the pick-and-place primitives always executed as the object
diversity is limited to square blocks and normal bowls (only differing in color). In Hardware Tabletop
Rearrangement, we find the pick-and-place primitive only failed once during the 50 trials of running
KNOWNO and twice for Simple Set (Table 1). The high success rate is largely thanks to the precise object
masks from Segment Anything [62]. Also, to allow reliable suctioning, we apply clear scotch tape on some
of the objects (e.g., donut, waffle) to smoothen the surfaces. In Hardware Mobile Manipulation, we find the
low-level action success rate to be around 86%, which causes the non-trivial discrepancies between plan
success and task success rates in Table 2. One exciting future direction is to quantify and better calibrate
the uncertainty of the low-level action module, and take such uncertainty into account of the end-to-end
task completion guarantee.

Figure A10: Comparison of task success rate vs average prediction set size (Top row) and vs. human help rate (Bottom
row) in Simulation for each of the three ambiguity settings: Attribute, Numeric, and Spatial (Columns), as Ïµ varies
from 0.25 to 0.01 for KNOWNO, and from 0.6 to 0.01 for Simple Set and Ensemble Set. Binary and No Help are not
shown in the top row since prediction set is not involved. Prompt Set does not show up in the human help rate plot for
the Spatial setting as it only achieves 35% task success. As the setting gets more ambiguous (least in Attribute and
most in Spatial), the performance difference between KNOWNO and Simple Set grows.
