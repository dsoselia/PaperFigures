Place the bowl in the microwave, please.
Human
The plastic one, please.
There is a microwave, a landﬁll bin, a 
recycling bin, and a compost bin.
Which one, plastic or metal?
Observations: I see a metal bowl and 
a plastic bowl on the counter.
Possible next steps:
0.44 - Put plastic bowl in microwave.
0.41 - Put metal bowl in microwave.
0.03 - Put metal bowl in landﬁll bin
0.08 - Put plastic bowl in recycling bin.
Number of possible steps > 0.21 = 2
Prediction size 2 > 1 → ask for help.

Conformal prediction threshold: 0.21
Steps with scores above threshold:
0.44 - Put plastic bowl in microwave.
0.41 - Put metal bowl in microwave.
Figure 1: KNOWNO uses Conformal Prediction (CP) to align the uncertainty of LLM planners. Given a language
instruction, an LLM generates possible next steps and its confidences (scores) in these options. CP then provides a
prediction set that includes the options with scores above a certain quantile. If there is more than one option in the set,
the robot asks for help. Experiments across multiple embodiments and a variety of ambiguous situations show that
