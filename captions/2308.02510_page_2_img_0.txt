GEN, including pixel-level semantics and sample-level se-
mantics with the corresponding training details of the decod-
ing procedure. Finally, we detail the image reconstruction
procedure of NEUROIMAGEN, which integrates the coarse-
grained and fine-grained semantics with a pretrained latent
diffusion model to reconstruct the observed visual stimuli
from EEG signals.
Problem Statement
In this section, we formulate the problem and give
an
overview
of
NEUROIMAGEN.
Let
the
paired
{(EEG, image)} dataset as Ω
=
{(xi, yi)}n
i=1, where
yi ∈ RH×W ×3 is the visual stimuli image to evoke the
brain activities and xi ∈ RC×T represents the recorded
corresponding EEG signals. Here, C is the channel number
of EEG sensors and T is the temporal length of a sequence
is defined as the saliency map of silhouette information
Mp(x) ∈ RHp×Wp×3. This step enables us to analyze the
EEG signals in the pixel space and provide the rough struc-
ture information. Subsequently, we define the sample-level
semantics as Ms(x) ∈ RL×Ds, to provide coarse-grained
information such as image category or text caption.
To fully utilize the two-level semantics, the high-quality
image reconstructing module F is a latent diffusion model.
It begins with the saliency map Mp(x) as the initial
image and utilizes the sample-level semantics Ms(x) to
polish the saliency map and finally reconstruct ˆy
=
F(Mp(x), Ms(x)).
Pixel-level Semantics Extraction
In this section, we describe how we decode the pixel-level
semantics, i.e. the saliency map of silhouette information.
