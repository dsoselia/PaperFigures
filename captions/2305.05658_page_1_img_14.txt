learn generic (non-personalized) rules about where
objects typically go inside a house by averag-
ing over many users (Taniguchi et al., 2021;
Kant et al., 2022; Sarch et al., 2022). Works
that focus on personalization aim to extrapolate
from a few user examples given similar choices
made by other users, using methods such as
collaborative filtering (Abdo et al., 2015), spa-
tial relationships (Kang et al., 2018), or learned
latent preference vectors (Kapelyukh and Johns,
