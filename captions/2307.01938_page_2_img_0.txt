Fig. 2. Overview of our system. The policy 𝜋 receives the Quest sensor input 𝐴���𝐴���,𝐴���𝐴���𝐴���𝐴��� and the current state
of the simulated character 𝐴���𝐴���,𝐴���𝐴���𝐴��� as observation and computes torques 𝐴���𝐴��� to apply to a physics simulator.
During training, we use human motion capture data 𝐴���𝐴���,𝐴���𝐴��� to estimate a rough pose 𝐴���𝐴���,𝐴���𝐴���𝐴��� of the simulated
character ("kinematic retargeting"). The reward encourages the simulated character 𝐴���𝐴���,𝐴���𝐴���𝐴��� to imitate this
rough kinematic pose 𝐴���𝐴���,𝐴���𝐴���𝐴��� as best as possible, while respecting all the physical constraints imposed by the
simulator. After the policy is trained, full-body data or kinematic retargeting is not required anymore, and
the simulated character can be driven purely by the HMD and controller sparse sensor.
as Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) devices, e.g., [Huang et al. 2018; Jiang et al. 2022; von Marcard
et al. 2017].
When using AR/VR devices, systems are further limited by the sparse sensors available. Most
commonly available units are comprised of 3 tracker devices: a head-mounted device (HMD) and
two controllers, one for each hand. As a human motion tracking device, these are handicapped
by the lack of sensory information regarding the lower body and legs, which are essential to
synthesizing believable full-body motion. Multiple methods have been proposed to address this,
using transformers [Jiang et al. 2022; Vaswani et al. 2017], VAEs [Dittadi et al. 2021] and normalizing
flows generative models [Aliakbarian et al. 2022]. Being kinematic-based approaches, however,
these methods do not enforce physical properties and thus suffer from motion artifacts such as
foot-skating and jitter. Physics-based approaches have also recently been proposed [Winkler et al.
2022; Ye et al. 2022]. These both make use of reinforcement learning and physics to learn general
and robust policies that drive full-body avatars, conditioned on input from a VR device. These are
closest to the work we present in this paper, and have great promise, although come with their own
limitations. The Neural3Points method [Ye et al. 2022] is specific to a single user and uses auxiliary
losses and an intermediate full-body pose predictor. Relatedly, Winkler et al. [2022] proposes a
more direct approach that is able to control a simulated human avatar and generalizes to users
of different heights and multiple type of motions. Our work generalizes the method of Winkler
et al. [2022] in two important ways: (1) we learn physics-based retargeting to characters having
different morphologies, and (2) we enable real-time retargeting.

Retargeting Motions
The motion retargeting problem is that of remapping motion from a source character or skeleton,
often driven by motion capture data, to another character of possibly different dimensions. This
is a long-standing problem for which many solutions have been proposed. Arguably the most
challenging version of this problem arises when the source and target characters may differ
significantly in terms of their morphology and skeleton, as is also the case for our work.
