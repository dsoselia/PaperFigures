Figure 1: Illustration of the growth trend in the field of LLM-based autonomous agents. We present
the cumulative number of papers published from January 2021 to August 2023. We assign different
colors to represent various agent categories. For example, a game agent aims to simulate a game-
player, while a tool agent mainly focuses on tool using. For each time period, we provide a curated
list of studies with diverse agent categories.
In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable successes, demonstrating
significant potential in attaining human-like intelligence [120, 127, 11, 4, 146, 147]. This capability
arises from leveraging comprehensive training datasets alongside a substantial number of model
parameters. Building upon this capability, there has been a growing research area that employs
LLMs as central controllers to construct autonomous agents to obtain human-like decision-making
capabilities [21, 139, 138, 126, 133, 184, 136]. Along this direction, researchers have developed
numerous promising models (see Figure 1 for an overview of this field), where the key idea is to equip
LLMs with crucial human capabilities like memory and planning to make them behave like humans
and complete various tasks effectively. Previously, these models were proposed independently, with
limited efforts made to summarize and compare them holistically. However, we believe a systematic
summary on this rapidly developing field is of great significance to comprehensively understand it
and benefit to inspire future research.
In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the field of LLM-based autonomous agents.
Specifically, we organize our survey based on three aspects including the construction, application,
