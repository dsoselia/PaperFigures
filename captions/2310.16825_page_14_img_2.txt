Training Dataset Details
B.1
LAION-2B
The fact that LAION is not a stable benchmark can lead to multiple reproducability and security
issues. Data poisoning attacks would be difficult to detect at the scale of 2 billion parameters. While
this could be mitigated by using hash values of the images, then any time the a site decide to re-
encode the image, those images would now need to be excluded from the dataset. Furthermore,
targeted data poisoning attacks for diffusion models are no longer just academic conjecture. Last
year after the release of Stable Diffusion, a protest was launched on ArtStation that had uses upload
images that said “NoAI” to taint future training data for generative models after artists felt as though
their work had been unfairly used to train the models. With the high degree of link rot, targeted
attacks are fairly easy. Furthermore, reproduction of the experiments becomes virtually impossible.
This means any benchmarks that use copies of LAION as ground truth are are likely using differing
subsets of the full dataset.

Sourcing Creative-Commons images
Table 1: CC licenses in YFCC100M. ND means derivative works are not licensed or the license
doesn’t allow the user to create derivative works. NC means images cannot be used in commercial
contexts. CommonCatalog-C only contains data from the bottom two (yellow) rows, reflecting
images licensed for commercial contexts (i.e., roughly 25 million images). CommonCatalog-NC
contains CommonCatalog-C, and additionally includes the middle two (blue) rows, reflecting images
licensed for non-commercial purposes. We do not include the roughly 30 million images in the
top two (pink) rows in CommonCatalog, as they are non-derivative licenses. We do not train on
these images. We do, however, produce BLIP-2 captions for them and release those captions as an
evaluation set.
