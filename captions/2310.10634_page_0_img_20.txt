ABSTRACT
Language agents show potential in being capable of utilizing natural language for
varied and intricate tasks in diverse environments, particularly when built upon
large language models (LLMs). Current language agent frameworks aim to fa-
cilitate the construction of proof-of-concept language agents while neglecting the
non-expert user access to agents and paying little attention to application-level de-
signs. We present OpenAgents, an open platform for using and hosting language
agents in the wild of everyday life. OpenAgents includes three agents: (1) Data
Agent for data analysis with Python/SQL and data tools; (2) Plugins Agent with
200+ daily API tools; (3) Web Agent for autonomous web browsing. OpenAgents
enables general users to interact with agent functionalities through a web user in-
terface optimized for swift responses and common failures while offering develop-
ers and researchers a seamless deployment experience on local setups, providing
a foundation for crafting innovative language agents and facilitating real-world
evaluations. We elucidate the challenges and opportunities, aspiring to set a foun-
dation for future research and development of real-world language agents.

Figure 1: The OpenAgents platform for general users, developers, and researchers. (a) General users
can interact with the agents via our online web interface, instead of programmer-oriented console or
packages. (b) Developers can effortlessly deploy the frontend and backend for further developments
given our codes. (c) Researchers can build new language agents or agent-related methods given
the examples and shared components, and see how they perform with the web UI. Our OpenAgents
serves to be a simple and versatile platform for using, developing, and evaluating language agents.
∗Equal contribution.
