Fig. 3. Generative Disco system design. Users begin by interacting with the waveform to create intervals within the music (A). To find
prompts that will define the start and end of intervals (C), users can brainstorm prompts using suggestions from GPT-4 (B, D) and
explore text-to-image generations (E, I). Results users like can be dragged and dropped into the start and end areas (C), after which an
interval can be generated. Generated intervals show in the Tracks (G) and can be stitched into a video placed in the Video Area (H).

DESIGNING WITH GENERATIVE DISCO
From these design goals, we designed a system for music visualization targeted at professionals. While visuals can be
generated for music of any length, we focus on generating short segments of music visualization (under one minute).

The Generative Disco interface
In the following section, we walk through how Generative Disco generates music videos. Generative Disco’s target
users are audiovisual professionals and experienced hobbyists who seek novel, eye-catching visualizations. These can
include professionals such as video jockeys (VJs), lyric video artists, music video editors, Youtubers and so on. We walk
through a motivating example using a user persona: Naomi, who has created a remix for a Daft Punk song, "One More
Time" and would like to upload her remix online. Naomi is a mashup artist who puts her remixes of pop songs on
Spotify. She wants to generate a short visualizer that will loop when people listen to her remix.
The system begins by loading the audio file of her remix as a waveform (Fig. 3-A). Naomi chooses a segment she
would like to visualize which has both a melodic and vocal hook. To begin working with this segment, Naomi draws
