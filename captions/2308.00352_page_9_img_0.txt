Knowledge Sharing Mechanism & Customized Knowledge Management
In MetaGPT, each agent proactively curates personalized knowledge by retrieving relevant historical messages from
shared environment logs. Instead of passively relying on dialogues, agents utilize role-based interests to extract
relevant information. Specifically, the environment replicates messages to provide a unified data repository. Agents
register subscriptions based on message types that are meaningful for their roles. Matching messages are automatically
dispatched to notify the appropriate agents. Internally, agents maintain a memory cache that indexes subscribed
messages by their content, publishing agent, and other attributes. The retrieval mechanism allows agents to acquire
additional contextual details by querying this storage. Updates synchronize across the memories of linked agents to
maintain a consistent view. This decentralized yet unified access pattern mirrors how human organizations function.
Team members have shared records but customize their views based on their responsibilities. By structuring information
flows based on agent roles, MetaGPT enables autonomous agents to effectively access relevant knowledge.
As previously discussed, each agent in MetaGPT maintains a memory cache that indexes subscribed messages relevant
to its role, allowing for personalized knowledge curation. Specifically, the centralized replication of messages creates a
unified data source. Agents can register subscriptions to automatically receive role-relevant messages from this source.
Internally, the agent indexes memory caches by content, source, and attributes to facilitate quick retrieval in the relevant
context. Rather than relying on one-size-fits-all communications, this decentralized yet federated knowledge ecosystem
mirrors the way human teams customize information views based on individual responsibilities while still relying on
shared records.
Message sharing.
Whenever an agent generates a message, it is replicated to the shared environment log, creating a
single source of truth. This ensures all agents have access to the same information.
Role-based subscriptions.
Agents can register subscriptions based on their roles and the types of messages that are
meaningful to them. This is done based on predefined criteria that align with the agentâ€™s responsibilities and tasks.
Message dispatch.
When a new message meets the subscription criteria, it is automatically dispatched to notify the
relevant agent. This active dissemination of information prevents agents from missing out on important updates.
