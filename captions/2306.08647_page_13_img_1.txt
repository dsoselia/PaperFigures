• walk(forward_speed, sideway_speed, turning_speed) controls the robot to walk and
turn in different directions. This is a common interface used in quadruped robots to navigate
in different environments.
• set_joint_poses(leg_name, joint_angles) directly sets the joint positions for each DoF
on the robot. To help the LLMs understand the joint angles, we provide a set of examples in
the prompt.
For the dexterous manipulator robot, we use three primitive skills to control the robot motion and also
a function to get access to the position of an object in the scene:
• end_effector_to(position) moves the center of the robot hand’s palm to the given
position.
• end_effector_open() opens the hand of the robot by extending all fingers.
• end_effector_close() closes the hand to form a grasping pose.
• get_object_position(obj_name) gets the position of a certain object in the scene.
• get_joint_position(joint_name) gets the position of a certain joint in the scene.

Full Prompts
Here we list the full prompts used in Reward Translator for all experiments used in this work.
i) Motion Descriptor Prompt for Quadruped
Describe the motion of a dog robot using the following form:
[start of description]
The torso of the robot should roll by [NUM: 0.0] degrees towards right, the torso should pitch upward
at [NUM: 0.0] degrees.
The height of the robot’s CoM or torso center should be at [NUM: 0.3] meters.
The robot should {CHOICE: [face certain direction, turn at certain speed]}. If facing certain direction,
it should be facing {CHOICE: [east, south, north, west]}. If turning, it should turn at [NUM: 0.0]
degrees/s.
The robot should {CHOICE: [go to a certain location, move at certain speed]}. If going to certain
location, it should go to (x=[NUM: 0.0], y=[NUM: 0.0]). If moving at certain speed, it should move
forward at [NUM: 0.0]m/s and sideways at [NUM: 0.0]m/s (positive means left).
[optional] front_left foot lifted to [NUM: 0.0] meters high.
