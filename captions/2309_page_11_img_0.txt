What would the missing image look like?
GPT-4V:
The missing image would likely be a variation of the 
diamond or star shape, as seen in the other three images. It 
could be a diamond with a different pattern or color, or a star 
with a different number of points or color. It is difficult to say 
for sure without more context, but it would likely follow the 
same theme as the other images.
Prompt:
Write a sentence for the image consisting only 
of words starting with the letter 'B'/ 'D'/ 'T'.
GPT-4V:
'B': Beachside bar boasts beautiful blue 
backdrop.
'D': Dining deck displays delightful drinks, 
distant docks.
'T': Tabletop terrace teeming with tropical 
tranquility.
Prompt:
Here are three sub images arranged in a 2-by-2 matrix. First, 
look at the two images in the first column, in the top left and 
bottom left. Then, find out the pattern in the first column 
based on the left two images. Next, use the found pattern 
and the image in the top right to infer the missing figure. 
Finally, describe what would the missing image look like?
GPT-4V:
The pattern in the first column is that the shape in the bottom 
left image has a dot in the center of the shape in the top left 
image. Therefore, the missing image in the bottom right 
would be a star with a dot in the center, similar to the image 
in the top right but with a dot in the center.
