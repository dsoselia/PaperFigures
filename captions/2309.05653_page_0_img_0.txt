ABSTRACT
We introduce MAmmoTH, a series of open-source large language models (LLMs)
specifically tailored for general math problem-solving. The MAmmoTH models are
trained on MathInstruct, our meticulously curated instruction tuning dataset.
MathInstruct is compiled from 13 math datasets with intermediate rationales,
six of which have rationales newly curated by us. It presents a unique hybrid
of chain-of-thought (CoT) and program-of-thought (PoT) rationales, and also en-
sures extensive coverage of diverse fields in math. The hybrid of CoT and PoT not
only unleashes the potential of tool use but also allows different thought processes
for different math problems. As a result, the MAmmoTH series substantially outper-
form existing open-source models on nine mathematical reasoning datasets across
all scales with an average accuracy gain between 16% and 32%. Remarkably,
our MAmmoTH-7B model reaches 33% on MATH (a competition-level dataset),
which exceeds the best open-source 7B model (WizardMath) by 23%, and the
MAmmoTH-34B model achieves 44% accuracy on MATH, even surpassing GPT-
4’s CoT result. Our work underscores the importance of diverse problem coverage
and the use of hybrid rationales in developing superior math generalist models.

Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. 
Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of 
babysitting. How much did she earn?
Weng earns 12/60 = 0.2 per minute.
Doing 50 mins, she earned 0.2 x 50 = 10
hourly_rate = 12; time_worked = 50/60;
earnings = hourly_rate * time_worked;
print(round(earnings, 2))
