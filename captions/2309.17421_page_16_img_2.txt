Sec. 3.2 Visual Referring Prompting
(1) Prompt:
Describe the pointed region in the image.
GPT-4V:
The pointed region in the image is a row of 
hanging lights on a wire. The lights are small 
and round, and they are evenly spaced along 
the wire. The wire is stretched between two 
poles and is located above a patio area with 
tables and umbrellas. The lights appear to be 
decorative and are likely used to provide 
ambient lighting in the evening.
(2) Prompt:
Describe the pointed region in the image.
GPT-4V:
The highlighted red region in the image is a table cell that 
contains a numerical value of 122.3. It is located in the "Test 
set" section of the table, under the "out" column and the "GIT2" 
row. This value represents the overall performance metric for 
the GIT2 method on the test set, in the "out" category.
Visual Pointing and Visual Referring Prompting
(3) Prompt:
What is in the circled glass? Object 1 or 2?
Describe what is Object 1 and object 2. Then 
check what is in the circled glass.
GPT-4V:
Object 1 is a glass bottle of water. It is clear 
and has a blue label on it.
Object 2 is a glass bottle of Magna beer. It is 
green and has a red and white label on it.
In the circled glass, it appears to be a clear 
liquid, likely water. So, it is likely that the 
contents of the circled glass are from Object 1, 
the glass bottle of water.
(4) Prompt:
Answer the question in the following figure. Provide 
intermediate steps.
GPT-4V:
To find the length of the blue arrowed edge, we can use the 
Pythagorean theorem since we have a right triangle. The 
theorem states that a² + b² = c², where a and b are the two legs 
of the right triangle and c is the hypotenuse. Plugging in the 
values we have, we get:
4² + 8² = c²    16 + 64 = c²    80 = c²    √80 = c    8.94 ≈ c
Therefore, the length of the blue arrowed edge is approximately 
8.94.
To find the angle at the green arrow, we can use the tangent 
function since we have the opposite and adjacent sides of the 
angle. The tangent function states that tanθ = 
opposite/adjacent. Plugging in the values we have, we get:
tanθ = 4/8    tanθ = 1/2    θ = tan^-1(1/2)    θ ≈ 26.57°
Therefore, the angle at the green arrow is approximately 
26.57°.
Figure 6: GPT-4V demonstrates the unique capability of understanding visual pointing directly
overlaid on images. Based on such capability, we explore visual referring prompting that edits input
image pixels (e.g., drawing visual pointers and scene texts) to prompt the task of interest. Check
Section 3.2 for detailed discussions.
