Abstract
Large
Vision-Language
Models
(LVLMs)
such
as
MiniGPT-4 and LLaVA have demonstrated the capability
of understanding images and achieved remarkable perfor-
mance in various visual tasks. Despite their strong abili-
ties in recognizing common objects due to extensive train-
ing datasets, they lack specific domain knowledge and have
a weaker understanding of localized details within objects,
which hinders their effectiveness in the Industrial Anomaly
Detection (IAD) task. On the other hand, most existing IAD
methods only provide anomaly scores and necessitate the
manual setting of thresholds to distinguish between normal
and abnormal samples, which restricts their practical im-
plementation. In this paper, we explore the utilization of
LVLM to address the IAD problem and propose Anoma-
