EFFECTS OF CONTRASTIVE DECODING
CD is worse at arithmetic but better at logical reasoning.
We conduct a manual error analysis
of 100 randomly selected examples from the GSM8K set between continuations from greedy decod-
ing and CD (β = 0.5, α = 0.1). We follow Wang et al. (2023a) and categorize wrong answers as
primarily being due to an arithmetic error, a missing step or a semantic misunderstanding. We add
one category of “degeneration,” chosen when the model lapses into excessive repetition. Our small-
scale analysis finds that CD makes more arithmetic errors, but that this is offset by better semantic
reasoning and fewer missing steps (see Table 5).
Table 5: Proportion of errors in of a set of 100 GSM8K questions. CD makes more
arithmetic errors, but omits fewer steps and avoids semantic misunderstandings.

To further explore the claim that the benefit of CD does not stem from arithmetic evaluation, we
generate a toy dataset of 1,0000 multiplication and subtraction equations with operands up to four
digits and then 8-shot prompt models to complete the expression, measuring exact match accuracy.
We find that CD does not improve performance on this task, and in fact may degrade it slightly.
Results are shown in Table 8.
