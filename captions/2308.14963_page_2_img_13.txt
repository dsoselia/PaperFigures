Top-k Retrieval
Figure 1: A standard bi-encoder architecture, where encoders generate dense vector representations
(embeddings) from queries and documents (passages). Retrieval is framed as k-nearest neighbor
search in vector space.
Modern enterprise architectures are already exceedingly complex, and the addition of another software
component (i.e., a distinct vector store) requires carefully weighing costs as well as benefits. The
cost is obvious: increased complexity, not only from the introduction of a new component, but also
from interactions with existing components. What about the benefits? While vector stores no doubt
introduce new capabilities, the critical question is whether these capabilities can be provided via
alternative means.
