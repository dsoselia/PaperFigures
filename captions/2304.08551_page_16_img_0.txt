Fig. 8. Illustrating holds participants created. Holds encourage focus on a subject within a generated interval. Participants achieved
holds by fixing the seed or using variations of the same prompt. Examples of holds where the start and end prompt were variations of
one another are seen in rows 1-2. Examples of holds where the seed is fixed are seen in rows 3-4. Holds were still dynamic. they had
minimal yet subtle change (e.g. color shifts).
