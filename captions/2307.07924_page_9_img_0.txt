self-reflection number in the dialogue ranges from 1 to 4, with an average of 1.24. In most cases,
agents can autonomously conclude the dialogue based on predefined communication protocols.
On average, a chat chain contains 45.60 utterances, ranging from a minimum of 24 to a maximum of
104. The count of utterances encompasses discussions related to achievability of subtasks, evaluations
of generated code quality, feedback on testing, advice for improvements, and the actual writing and
generation of software code files and documents. Likewise, we have observed that CHATDEV tends
to engage in less communication through utterances for abstract tasks compared to specific tasks,
averaging around 34.40 utterances. Analysis of the dialogues revealed that during the design and
coding stages, agents conducted multiple rounds of discussions to delve into the details of numerous
requirements or propose modification suggestions. These discussions aimed to make informed
decisions regarding the specific tasks at hand. This phenomenon aligns with real-world practices,
where addressing specific tasks often involves more detailed discussions and deliberations.
We monitored API interactions and token usage during software production in CHATDEV. On
average, CHATDEV requires 36,902.23 prompt tokens, 11,567.37 completion tokens, and a total
of 48,469.60 tokens to develop a single software. The average total cost in software production is
approximately $0.15693. To determine the overall cost of software development with CHATDEV,
we also consider the cost of designer-produced images. The average designer cost is $0.1398 per
software for each software production involving 8.74 graphics creations on average. Thus, the
average software development cost at CHATDEV is $0.2967, significantly lower than traditional
custom software development companies’ expenses [18; 21; 31].
Reviewer-Programmer Dialogue Analysis
In this section, we delve into the primary exchanges
between the reviewer and the programmer, specifically concerning code-related matters during the
coding phase. We summarize the reviewer’s evaluations of the programmer’s source code at the
coding stage. Figure 7 provides a visual representation of the reviewer’s suggestions in the form of
pie charts. As depicted in the figure, the most frequently discussed issue in the reviewer-programmer
communication during code review is “methods not implemented” (34.85%). This challenge
commonly arises in code generation for complex models, where core functionalities often receive
