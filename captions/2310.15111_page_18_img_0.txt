Cascaded Diffusion Model
For our cascaded diffusion baseline models, we closely follow the guidelines from
(Ho et al.,
2022b) while making it directly comparable to our models. In particular, our cascaded diffusion
models consist of two resolutions, 64x64 and 256x246. Here the 64x64 resolution models share the
same architecture and training hyper parameters as MDM. For the upsampler network from 64x64
