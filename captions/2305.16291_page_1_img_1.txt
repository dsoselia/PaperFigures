tasks like combating monsters and crafting diamond tools. We argue that an effective lifelong learning
agent should have similar capabilities as human players: (1) propose suitable tasks based on its
current skill level and world state, e.g., learn to harvest sand and cactus before iron if it finds itself in
a desert rather than a forest; (2) refine skills based on environmental feedback and commit mastered
skills to memory for future reuse in similar situations (e.g. fighting zombies is similar to fighting
spiders); (3) continually explore the world and seek out new tasks in a self-driven manner.
Towards these goals, we introduce VOYAGER, the first LLM-powered embodied lifelong learning
agent to drive exploration, master a wide range of skills, and make new discoveries continually
without human intervention in Minecraft. VOYAGER is made possible through three key modules
(Fig. 2): 1) an automatic curriculum that maximizes exploration; 2) a skill library for storing
and retrieving complex behaviors; and 3) a new iterative prompting mechanism that generates
executable code for embodied control. We opt to use code as the action space instead of low-level
motor commands because programs can naturally represent temporally extended and compositional
actions [16, 22], which are essential for many long-horizon tasks in Minecraft. VOYAGER interacts
