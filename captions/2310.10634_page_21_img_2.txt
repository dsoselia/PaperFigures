KEY PROMPTS IN OpenAgents (AGENTS)
The main technique behind OpenAgents is LLMs prompting, it is crucial for building applications
upon LLMs and controls the quality (e.g. retrying after failure), functionalities (e.g. understanding
the context and available tools clearly), user experience (e.g. whether the response is in good format)
and even safety (e.g. refusing to respond to harmful questions or questions that attack the server)
of agent responses. Here we show key prompts we explore and use to prompt LLMs to serve as
real-world agents. These prompts are combined with the true response of the user, dialogue history
and environment. Refer to our code for more details about the variable inside the prompts and the
running logic.
