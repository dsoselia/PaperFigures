of segmentation task without fine-tuning. Our SAM-Med2D demonstrated advantages in Dice scores
across all anatomical structures compared to other methods. Due to the limited information provided
by a 1 pt prompt, there were performance differences across different categories. Interesting, we
found that the fine-tuned SAM significantly outperformed the original SAM. This is because the
fine-tuning approach learned the positional relationships of points within the target regions from a
large-scale medical image dataset, enabling more accurate decision-making.
Based on the aforementioned results, we draw the conclusion that SAM-Med2D exhibits excellent
performance in the segmentation tasks across different anatomical structures, yielding satisfactory
results in terms of the Dice metric in the pelvic and thoracic areas. However, it is worth noting that
the performance of the head and neck region appears to be relatively subpar across different models
and resolutions, suggesting the need for additional improvement measures.

different models under 1 pt prompt. The numbers in parentheses indicate the Dice score increment
after 5 pts prompt, with red indicating improvement and green indicating decline.

C. Performance Evaluation on Different Modalities. Figure 5 (b) summarizes the performance
of the four methods under the Bbox prompt mode across different modality data. All four methods
achieved Dice scores exceeding 70% in dermoscopy, endoscopy, fundus photography, histopathology,
and microscopy. When deploying predicted images at a resolution of 1024×1024, SAM outperformed
other methods in endoscopy, histopathology, and microscopy modes. We attribute this results to
the following factors: 1) These three modalities are derived from 2D datasets and consist of RGB
images, which share similarities with natural images. 2) The limited amount of available data for
fine-tuning constrained the performance of the fine-tuning method (as indicated by the red lines in
the figure, representing the logarithmically transformed mask counts). 3) Larger image resolutions
