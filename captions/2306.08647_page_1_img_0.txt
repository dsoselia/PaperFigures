this gap, by proposing a system (right) consisting of the Reward Translatorthat interprets the user input and transform
it into a reward specification. The reward specification is then consumed by a Motion Controller that interactively
synthesizes a robot motion which optimizes the given reward.
bridges the gap between language and low-level robot actions. This is motivated by the fact that language
instructions from humans often tend to describe behavioral outcomes instead of low-level behavioral details
(e.g. “robot standing up” versus “applying 15 Nm to hip motor”), and therefore we posit that it would be
easier to connect instructions to rewards than low-level actions given the richness of semantics in rewards.
In addition, reward terms are usually modular and compositional, which enables concise representations
of complex behaviors, goals, and constraints. This modularity further creates an opportunity for the user
