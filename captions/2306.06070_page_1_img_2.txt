Figure 1: Sample tasks and all domains featured in MIND2WEB. The array of diversity allows for
testing an agent’s generalizability across tasks on the same website (a vs. b), similar tasks on different
websites (a vs. c), and even to entirely disparate tasks, websites, and domains (d−f).
about the environments but must embrace the full complexity and sometimes noise, e.g., due to
sub-optimal website designs. Finally, it shall support diverse and sophisticated interactions with
websites. Tasks from users can be highly diverse and take a large number of steps to complete (e.g.,
the task in Figure 1(b) would take 14 actions). An agent that only supports simple tasks may provide
limited value to users.
Building an agent for the web is not entirely new. There have been numerous prior efforts in
varied forms. However, none of them meets all the requirements for a generalist agent listed above.
Existing work falls short in one to all of the following aspects: 1) Only operating in a limited and
pre-specified set of websites [3, 18, 19, 32, 37], 2) making strong simplifying assumptions about the
websites [19, 37], and 3) only supporting specific types of tasks [18, 19, 37] and/or requiring tedious
step-by-step instructions from users [3, 18, 19, 36]. Meanwhile, LLMs have been shown to excel at
grounded language understanding in complex environments with good generalizability and sample
efficiency [2, 10, 14, 30]. It is therefore promising to explore LLMs as a candidate solution towards
generalist agents for the web. However, there lacks a good dataset that can support the development
and evaluation of generalist web agents, which is the focus of this work.
In light of this, we present MIND2WEB, a new dataset with natural language tasks and manually
annotated action sequences for developing and evaluating generalist agents for the web. It offers the
following unique features:
1. Diverse coverage of domains, websites, and tasks. MIND2WEB boasts a collection of over 2,000
tasks curated from 137 websites that span 31 different domains. This extensive range of tasks and
domains not only provides a vast landscape for exploration and learning but also opens up a new level
of versatility and complexity, fostering a more comprehensive evaluation of generalist web agents.
