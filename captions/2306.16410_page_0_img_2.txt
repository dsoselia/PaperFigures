Abstract
We propose LENS
, a modular approach for tackling computer vision problems by leveraging
the power of large language models (LLMs). Our system uses a language model to reason over
outputs from a set of independent and highly descriptive vision modules that provide exhaustive
information about an image. We evaluate the approach on pure computer vision settings such
as zero- and few-shot object recognition, as well as on vision and language problems. LENS
can be applied to any off-the-shelf LLM and we find that the LLMs with LENS perform highly
