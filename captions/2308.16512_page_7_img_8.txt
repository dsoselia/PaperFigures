3D GENERATION WITH MULTI-VIEW SCORE DISTILLATION
We compare our multi-view SDS with existing text-to-3D methods. We implement our method in
threestudio (thr) and use reproduced baselines in this framework for comparison. We consider the
following baselines: dreamfusion-IF (Poole et al., 2023), magic3d-IF (Lin et al., 2023a), text2mesh-
IF (Tsalicoglou et al., 2023), and prolificdreamer (Wang et al., 2023c). Note that the implementation in
threestudio could be different from the original papers. For example, dreamfusion-IF, magic3d-IF and
text2mesh-IF use DeepFloyd (dee) as their guidance model while original ones use Imagen (Saharia
et al., 2022) and eDiff-I (Balaji et al., 2022), which are private. Original dreamfusion uses Mip-
NeRF 360 (Barron et al., 2022) for 3D representation, but all methods here (including ours) use
multi-resolution hash-grid (Müller et al., 2022) (except Text2Mesh that uses SDF). We believe
that these baselines represent the best re-implementation we could find. To test the performance
comprehensively, we collected 40 prompts from various sources, including prior studies, internet
prompts for image generation, and user inputs from a 3D generation website (lum). As shown in
Fig. (6), all baselines suffer from severe multi-view inconsistency. Magic3D performs relatively better
by using DMTet Shen et al. (2021) for second stage refinement. Prolificdreamer shows good texture
quality for every view, but jointly they do not appear to be a reasonable 3D object. In comparison, the
