of HQ-SAM, accurate masks can also be segmented when
facing challenges such as object appearance changes, fast
motion, and scale changes.
5. Conclusion
In this report, we propose Tracking Anything in High
Quality (HQTrack). HQTrack mainly consists of a video
multi-object segmenter (VMOS) and a mask refiner (MR).
VMOS is responsible for propagating multiple targets in
video frames, and MR is a large-scale pre-trained seg-
mentation model in charge of refining the segmentation
masks.
HQTrack demonstrates powerful object tracking
and segmentation capabilities. Finally, HQTrack achieves
the 2nd place in the Visual Object Tracking and Segmenta-
tion (VOTS2023) challenge.
