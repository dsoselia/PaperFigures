Figure 3: Qualitative comparison of our method and baselines on DAVIS [50]. The leftmost image shows query points in the first frame, and
the right three images show tracking results over time. Notably, our method tracks successfully through the occlusion events in swing and
india, while baseline methods fail. Our method additionally detects occlusion (marked as cross “+”) and gives plausible location estimates
even when a point is occluded. Please refer to the supplemental video for better visualizations of tracking accuracy and coherence.
temporal coherence consistently across different datasets.
Our method works well with different input pairwise corre
clusion. Although PIPs considers a wider temporal window
(8 frames) for better occlusion handling it fails to track a
