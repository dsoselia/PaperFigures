proven effectiveness, they only enhance SAM’s segmentation capabilities within specific scenarios
resembling the training dataset. As a result, their applicability is limited for more diverse medical
image segmentation tasks.
2) Different prompt modes play important roles in different segmentation tasks when migrating SAM
to the medical field. As shown in Figure 2 (c), a relatively accurate polyp mask can be obtained by
using the bounding box prompt. In contrast, the mask quality is poor when clicking on a foreground
point (column d). With an increasing number of clicks, the segmentation result gradually improves
and even surpasses the performance of the bounding box prompt (e.g., liver segmentation). When
segmenting myocardium, using the bounding box prompt may include uninterested regions in the
result, while the point prompt allows us to gradually acquire the desired mask. Therefore, this paper
aims to fine-tune three prompt modes (point, bounding box, and mask) to meet the requirements
of different scenarios in medical image segmentation tasks. According to Table 1, our approach
involves a more comprehensive fine-tuning compared to other methods, which means our method
possesses a broader range of prompt segmentation capabilities in the medical image domain.
3) Adapters have been proven to be an effective strategy for fine-tuning large-scale models [21, 43].
They do not require retraining the entire model, ensuring that the original knowledge is not forgotten.
This enables an existing model to excel in both new and the original tasks. Due to the parameter-
sharing property of adapters, they facilitate transfer learning between different tasks. Therefore, this
paper applies Adapter to the encoder of SAM to learn domain-specific information in the field of
medical imaging. Additionally, the adapter layer is a plug-and-play component that allows us to
choose whether to keep or remove it during the testing process, according to our specific needs.
