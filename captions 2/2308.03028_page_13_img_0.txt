demonstrations but also from flawed ones.
As illustrated in Figure 3 and 4, distinct buildings correspond to unique expert policies even
under identical weather conditions, this indicates that expert demonstrations for one scenario are
probably not expert demonstrations for the others. Hence, by providing these demonstrations to
GPT-4 may mislead its decision-making, which explains the results in Table 2.
4.5. How important if we add different types of comments? Drawing inspiration from the
research on imitation learning (see e.g., Brown et al., 2019, 2020; Cai et al., 2022), our aim is
to enable GPT-4 to learn not only from well-crafted demonstrations but also from flawed ones.
To achieve this, we incorporate a comment into each demonstration. Based on the method of
generating these comments, we identify two distinct types:
• Manual: Comments are meticulously crafted in accordance with the feedbackTranslator
outlined in Section 3.
• Self-comment: Comments are automatically generated by GPT-4, which involves append-
ing the following instruction to the end of each prompt.
