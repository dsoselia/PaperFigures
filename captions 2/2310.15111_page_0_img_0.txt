Abstract
Diffusion models are the de-facto approach for generating high-quality images
and videos but learning high-dimensional models remains a formidable task due
to computational and optimization challenges. Existing methods often resort to
training cascaded models in pixel space, or using a downsampled latent space
of a separately trained auto-encoder.
In this paper, we introduce Matryoshka
Diffusion (MDM), an end-to-end framework for high-resolution image and video
