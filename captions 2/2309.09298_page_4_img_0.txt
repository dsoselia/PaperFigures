2.2 Dataset Augmentation
Single-turn Dataset Construction
In our endeavor, we have constructed a compre-
hensive single-turn dialogue dataset tailored specifically to the domain of operations and
maintenance, boasting an impressive 9,118 meticulously curated data entries. Drawing in-
spiration from the self-instruct approach (Wang et al., 2023a), we have taken an additional
step to further enrich our dataset. This enrichment involves the generation of supplementary
samples derived from the seed data, a corpus painstakingly labeled by our domain experts.
Our commitment to data quality extends to considering ChatGPT (Jiao et al., 2023) as
a reference and supervisor for ensuring the excellence of our dataset. This meticulous ap-
proach to dataset construction and enhancement underscores our dedication to facilitating
superior performance and robustness in the realm of operations and maintenance dialogue
systems.
Example Structure:
{”q”: ”Please answer the following questions: The server is running slowly and how to trou-
bleshoot and solve it”,
”a”: ”1. Check whether the server hardware resources are overloaded, such as CPU, memory,
disk space, etc. 2. Check whether the applications running on the server are running normally,
such as checking application logs, monitoring alarms, etc.” }
Multi-turn Dataset Construction
In accordance with the methodology elucidated in
Baize (Xu et al., 2023b), the generation process of our multi-turn dialogue dataset within
the operations and maintenance domain encompasses the following four distinct phases:
