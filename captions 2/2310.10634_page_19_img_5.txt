USE CASES
Presented below are exemplary use cases for the OpenAgents deployed demo. For comprehensive
video demonstrations, refer to the documentation. The provided cases only represent a fraction
of OpenAgents’ capabilities. Also, we encourage users to delve into our source code for a deeper
understanding.
For quick reference, we demonstrate the use cases of data agent, plugin agent, and web agent in
Figure 6, Figure 7, and Figure 8 respectively.
B.1
DATA AGENT
(a) Kaggle Dataset Search: Input your subject or do-
main preference, and the Data Agent will traverse the
Kaggle API to identify datasets fitting your specifica-
tions.
(b) Python Code Execution: Utilize the Python tool
to craft Python code and execute rudimentary data
sanitization on a given table.
(c) SQL Query Execution: Using the SQL tool, the
Data Agent can execute data queries on an input table
or dataset.
(d) Interactive Echarts Visualization: The Data
Agent employs the pyecharts package, transforming
it into a JSON object. This object can be rendered
as an interactive Echarts plot, as facilitated by the
ECharts library.
(e) Image Operations: Beyond textual and tabular
data, the Data Agent can also perform basic manipu-
lations on images.
(f) Interesting Cases:
Demonstrate the earth’s
roundness, create GIFs with descending letters, or
construct a word cloud from an academic article.
