Fig. 2. A list of six major audio-visual alignment patterns that we found in animated music videos. The patterns that we arrived
at were 1) images symbolizing the lyric 2) cutting on the beat or around a lyric 3) concurrent visual and audio changes 4) visual
consistency 5) singing 6) choreography. Examples are illustrated with popular music videos (artists labeled inline).
"You’re a firework", and fireworks explode on screen at the same time. When the lyrics and visuals align, the imagery
within the music can be illustrated and the emotions can be amplified.
Cutting on Beat or around Lyric. 46/50 animated music videos would cut to the beat of the music or around a new
lyric. (A cut is when the visuals would be fully replaced with new shots.) The example in Fig. 2 shows an animated
sequence where close-ups of a face and fight scenes rapidly alternate on changes of the beat. A clear mapping between
the beat structure and visuals for the listener can help them more actively engage with the structures latent in the
music.
Concurrent visual and audio changes. 45/50 animated music videos include a significant visual change when there
were drumbeats or tempo shifts. This visual change is noticeable but not as drastic as a jump cut. Instead, more subtle
transitions such as color filtering, angle changes, and texture overlays are used. For example, in “One More Time” by
Daft Punk, the scene color changes from green, to yellow, to red on each drumbeat (see Fig. 2). These visual changes are
most often quick visual transitions that help the storytelling along and establish an atmosphere.
