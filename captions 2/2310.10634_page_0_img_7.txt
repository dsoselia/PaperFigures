non-expert user access to agents and paying little attention to application-level de-
signs. We present OpenAgents, an open platform for using and hosting language
agents in the wild of everyday life. OpenAgents includes three agents: (1) Data
Agent for data analysis with Python/SQL and data tools; (2) Plugins Agent with
200+ daily API tools; (3) Web Agent for autonomous web browsing. OpenAgents
enables general users to interact with agent functionalities through a web user in-
terface optimized for swift responses and common failures while offering develop-
ers and researchers a seamless deployment experience on local setups, providing
a foundation for crafting innovative language agents and facilitating real-world
evaluations. We elucidate the challenges and opportunities, aspiring to set a foun-
dation for future research and development of real-world language agents.
