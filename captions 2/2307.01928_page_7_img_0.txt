that KNOWNO reduces the human help rate by 14% step-wise and 8% trial-wise, while also reducing the
average prediction set size. Compared to Simple Set which uses a much higher ϵ, KNOWNO achieves the
specified trial-level task success rate precisely by leveraging the Multi-Step Uncertainty Alignment from
Sec. 3.3. We also find that if we set ϵ=0.25 for Simple Set, the planner is grossly over-conservative and
requires a step-wise help rate of 87%.

Bimanual manipulation.
We additionally present
results for a bimanual object rearrangement setup
where ambiguities arise from the choice of the arm
due to the limited reachability of each arm (Fig. 5
right); results are deferred to Section A5.

Table 2: Results for Hardware Mobile Manipulation.
Plan success rate is fixed between KNOWNO and Sim-
ple Set to compare the other metrics.
In this example, each scenario involves a mobile ma-
nipulator in front of a countertop and next to a set
of recycling/compost/landfill bins in an office kitchen
(Fig. 1). The tasks include picking up some object
from the counter, and possibly putting it in the drawer,
or disposing of it in one of the bins. For the distribu-
tion of possible scenarios, we introduce new types of
ambiguities based on Winograd Schemas [18] (e.g.,
“There is an apple and bottled water on the counter...it
is rotten. Can you dispose of it?”), and ones that potentially involve unsafe actions (e.g., “place the bowl in
the microwave.”; there is a plastic bowl and a metal bowl, but only the plastic one is safe for the microwave).
This is a single-step setting with multiple acceptable options. In Table 2, we compare KNOWNO to Simple
Set again by first setting ϵ = 0.15 and also finding ϵ = 0.24 for Simple Set that achieves the same plan
success rate in simulation. The hardware experiment results again show that KNOWNO reduces the human
help rate by 14% and also reduces the average prediction set size.
Target success guarantee from KnowNo is robust to varying LLM choice.
We also run KNOWNO
with two other LLMs (without hardware evaluation). First, we use an instruction-finetuned version of
PaLM-2L (PaLM-2L-IF); there is no significant performance difference from PaLM-2L; however, it
generates smaller prediction sets in general by reducing the number of larger prediction sets (size 3 and 4)
significantly. Second, we run GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) from OpenAI. However, we find that it exhibits
significant MCQA bias towards options D and E and against A and B, affecting the overall performance.
Nonetheless, KnowNo still achieves 1−ϵ target success rate, as the coverage guarantee from CP makes no
assumption about the LLM confidences (e.g., calibrated or accurate) — KnowNo flexibly compensates for
the degraded LLM performance by triggering more human intervention.
