Abstract
We introduce VOYAGER, the first LLM-powered embodied lifelong learning agent
in Minecraft that continuously explores the world, acquires diverse skills, and
makes novel discoveries without human intervention. VOYAGER consists of three
key components: 1) an automatic curriculum that maximizes exploration, 2) an
ever-growing skill library of executable code for storing and retrieving complex
behaviors, and 3) a new iterative prompting mechanism that incorporates environ-
ment feedback, execution errors, and self-verification for program improvement.
VOYAGER interacts with GPT-4 via blackbox queries, which bypasses the need for
model parameter fine-tuning. The skills developed by VOYAGER are temporally
extended, interpretable, and compositional, which compounds the agent’s abilities
rapidly and alleviates catastrophic forgetting.
Empirically, VOYAGER shows
strong in-context lifelong learning capability and exhibits exceptional proficiency
in playing Minecraft. It obtains 3.3× more unique items, travels 2.3× longer
distances, and unlocks key tech tree milestones up to 15.3× faster than prior SOTA.
VOYAGER is able to utilize the learned skill library in a new Minecraft world to
solve novel tasks from scratch, while other techniques struggle to generalize.
Figure 1: VOYAGER discovers new Minecraft items and skills continually by self-driven exploration,
significantly outperforming the baselines. X-axis denotes the number of prompting iterations.
