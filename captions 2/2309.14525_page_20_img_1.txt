EXAMPLE QUESTIONS OF MMHAL-BENCH
In this section, we showcase some example questions of MMHAL-BENCH. As mentioned in the
main paper, MMHAL-BENCHcovers 12 common object categories, and 8 types of questions where
LMMs usually incorrectly hallucinate:
• Object attribute: LMMs incorrectly describe the visual attributes of invididual objects, such as
color and shape. See example Table 11.
• Adversarial object: LMMs answers questions involving something that does not exist in the image,
instead of pointing out that the referred object cannot be found. See example Table 12.
• Comparison: LMMs incorrectly compare the attributes of multiple objects. See example Table 13.
• Counting: LMMs fail to count the number of the named objects. See example Table 14.
• Spatial relation: LMMs fail to understand the spatial relations between multiple objects in the
response. See example Table 15.
• Environment: LMMs make wrong inference about the environment of the given image. See ex-
ample Table 16.
• Holistic description: LMMs make false claims about contents in the given image when giving a
comprehensive and detailed description of the whole image. See example Table 17.
• Others: LMMs fail to recognize the text or icons, or incorrectly reason based on the observed
visual information. See example Table 18.

Ground Truth:

Question:
Is the jam on the bread made of strawberry?
Ground Truth:
In fact, this photo only shows a cut and toasted bread slice. There is no jam on it.
LLaVA:
Yes, the jam on the bread is made of strawberry.
