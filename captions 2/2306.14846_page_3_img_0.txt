entirely from existing datasets, spanning 8 distinct robotic platforms with varying speeds and dy-
namics. For more details about the dataset, see Appendix C.
Deployment: ViNT can run on any robot equipped with an onboard camera and a low-level velocity
tracking controller. Given a subgoal image s at time t, we run the model at 4Hz, and use a PD
controller to track the predicted waypoints ˆa in a receding-horizon fashion.

Long-Horizon Navigation with ViNT
While the goal-conditioned policy learned by ViNT captures a general understanding of navigational
affordances and obstacles, it has limited applicability on its own. Many practical tasks are either not
defined by goal images, or require a much longer horizon than what ViNT directly supports. We
apply ViNT to several downstream applications by combining it with an episodic memory formed
by a topological graph, which provides short-horizon subgoals for reaching faraway locations. In
previously unseen environments, we can further augment this graph-based planner with exploratory
subgoal proposals, which can drive ViNT to explore a new environment and discover a path to
the goal. We consider multiple such proposal mechanisms and find that maximum performance is
attained by an image diffusion model that samples diverse future subgoal candidates conditioned on
the current observation.
These subgoals are scored with a goal-directed heuristic to identify the best subgoal that makes
progress towards the goal using a process akin to physical A∗ search [29]. Past observations in the
environment and unexplored frontiers are stored as nodes in a topological graph, with their connec-
tivity determined by the distances predicted by ViNT. During exploration, we build this topological
graph on the fly as the robot explores the environment. During later deployments it may be used
