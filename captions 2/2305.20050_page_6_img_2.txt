Majority Voting
Figure 3: A comparison of outcome-supervised and process-supervised reward
models, evaluated by their ability to search over many test solutions. Majority
voting is shown as a strong baseline. For N â‰¤ 1000, we visualize the variance
across many subsamples of the 1860 solutions we generated in total per problem.

Large-scale Supervision
We train the large-scale PRM using the step-level labels in PRM800K. To ensure
the large scale ORM baseline is as strong as possible we train on 100 uniform
