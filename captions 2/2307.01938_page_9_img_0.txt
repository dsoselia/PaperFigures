Real-time Retargeting with Headset and Controller
We thank the QuestSim [Winkler et al. 2022] authors for providing us with testing data and video
references. With our method, we are able to control different characters in real time with only
headset and controller information. Importantly, we are able to estimate the lower-body pose
of the user from only three points in the upper body and correctly match the user action while
transferring it to a character with a different morphology. Our virtual characters respect physical
behaviors and do not suffer from jittering, foot sliding or penetration. Moreover, we are able to
generalize to users not present in the training set and users of different heights. In Figure 7 we
show a sequence in which all three characters are controlled by an unseen user.

Retargeting using only Headset
Some VR systems provide only a head-mounted device (HMD), without the two controllers. This
provides an even more challenging domain, requiring the policy to predict a full-body pose and
control a virtual character from a one-point input. Nonetheless, our trained models are robust to
the lack of controller signal and are able to retarget real time user data from unseen users even
from this extremely sparse input, albeit with a lower quality compared to before. We invite the
reader to watch the video available in the supplementary material.
