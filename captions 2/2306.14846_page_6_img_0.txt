For the coverage exploration task, the agent is placed in an unknown environment and tasked with
exploring the environment maximally in search of the goal without any additional cues. Table 1
summarizes the success rates for this task in indoor and outdoor environments. We find that, while
end-to-end baselines avoid collisions with their surroundings, they fail to explore new areas and
often get stuck in small areas of the environment. Graph-based methods avoid this trap by explicitly
Indoor: Position
Outdoor: GPS
Outdoor: Satellite

Table 2: ViNT can effectively utilize goal-directed heuristics, such as 2D goal positions and satellite images,
to explore novel kilometer-scale environments successfully and without interventions.
