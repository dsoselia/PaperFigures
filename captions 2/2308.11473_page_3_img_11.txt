Figure 2. Pipeline of IT3D. Begin from a coarse 3D model, IT3D first generate a tiny posed dataset leveraging image-to-image pipeline
conditioning on rendering of the coarse 3D model. Then incorporate a randomly initialized discriminator to distill knowledge form the
generated dataset and update the 3D model with discrimination loss and SDS loss.

3D model of hulk, highly detailed, full body. The generated dataset incorporate 60 camera views and 5 samples for each view. Given
such a tiny but high variance dataset, (a) and (b) tend to result in noised refinement without the help of strong denoising ability of SDS
loss. Comparing (c) and (d), (c) compromises to the average of generated dataset while (d) successfully bridge the distribution gap
between coarse NeRF and generated dataset.

on this insight, we seek to tackle these concerns through the
incorporation of 2D image generation techniques (Fig. 2).
