ABSTRACT
Large language models (LLMs) with memory are computationally universal (Schuurmans, 2023).
However, mainstream LLMs are not taking full advantage of memory, and the designs are heavily
influenced by biological brains. Due to their approximate nature and proneness to the accumulation
of errors, conventional neural memory mechanisms cannot support LLMs to simulate complex
reasoning. In this paper, we seek inspiration from modern computer architectures to augment LLMs
with symbolic memory for complex multi-hop reasoning. Such a symbolic memory framework is
instantiated as an LLM and a set of SQL databases, where the LLM generates SQL instructions to
manipulate the SQL databases We validate the effectiveness of the proposed memory framework
