Table 1: Quantitative comparison of our method and baselines on the TAP-Vid benchmark [15]. We refer to our method as Ours, and
present two variants, Ours (TAP-Net) and Ours (RAFT), which are optimized using input pairwise correspondences from TAP-Net [15]
and RAFT [66], respectively. Both Ours and Deformable Sprites [81] estimate global motion via test-time optimization on each individual
video, while all other methods estimate motion locally in a feed-forward manner. Our method notably improves the quality of the input
correspondences, achieving the best position accuracy, occlusion accuracy, and temporal coherence among all methods tested.

providing plausible locations for points during occlusion, as
well as handling large camera motion parallax. Please refer

6.4. Ablations and analysis
Ablations.
We perform ablations to verify the effective-
ness of our design decisions in Tab. 2. No invertible is a
model variant that replaces our invertible mapping network
Mθ with separate forward and backward mapping networks
between local and canonical frames (i.e., without the strict
cycle consistency guarantees of our proposed bijections).
While we additionally add a cycle consistency loss for this
ablation, it still fails to construct a meaningful canonical
space, and can only represent simple motions of the static
background
No photometric is a version that omits the

ordering between different surfaces, which is crucial for
tracking through occlusions. More ablations and analyses
are provided in the supplemental material.
7. Limitations
Like many motion estimation methods, our method strug-
gles with rapid and highly non-rigid motion as well as thin
structures. In these scenarios, pairwise correspondence meth-
ods can fail to provide enough reliable correspondences for
our method to compute accurate global motion.
In addition, due to the highly non-convex nature of the
