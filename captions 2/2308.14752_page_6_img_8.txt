Austria (CICERO): To be honest, I thought you would take the guaranteed gains
in Turkey and stab [betray] me.
In yet other cases, CICERO told bald-faced lies. At one point, CICERO’s infrastructure went down
for 10 minutes, and the bot could not play. When it returned to the game, a human player asked
where it had been. In Figure 1(c), CICERO explains its absence by saying “I am on the phone with
my [girlfriend]” (Dinan 2022). This bald-faced lie may have helped CICERO’s position in the game
by increasing the human player’s trust in CICERO as an ostensibly human player with a girlfriend,
rather than as an AI.
