Fig. 1. The evolutionary tree of modern LLMs traces the development of language models in recent years and highlights some of the
most well-known models. Models on the same branch have closer relationships. Transformer-based models are shown in non-grey
colors: decoder-only models in the blue branch, encoder-only models in the pink branch, and encoder-decoder models in the green
branch. The vertical position of the models on the timeline represents their release dates. Open-source models are represented by
solid squares, while closed-source models are represented by hollow ones. The stacked bar plot in the bottom right corner shows the
number of models from various companies and institutions.
b) OpenAI consistently maintains its leadership position in LLM, both currently and potentially in the future. Other
companies and institutions are struggling to catch up with OpenAI in developing models comparable to GPT-3
and the current GPT-4. This leadership position may be attributed to OpenAIâ€™s steadfast commitment to its
technical path even when it was not widely acknowledged initially
