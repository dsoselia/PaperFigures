on generating commands [38] and programs [49, 12] to infer the choice of tools. However, this
approach needs to carefully tailor prompts to specific tasks and particular tools, and is neither
flexible nor adaptive. In contrast, Chameleon instructs LLMs with natural language instructions
that simply describe the roles of each module and provide a few calling examples, eliminating the
need for additional training or tool-specific prompts when learning to compose different tools. More
importantly, Chameleon offers users flexibility in terms of tool types and sources, updating the
underlying LLMs, adding new tools, and adapting to new tasks. Our work shares the same spirit of
AutoGPT [45], an autonomous GPT-4 agent with the artificial general intelligence (AGI) ambition to
incorporate numerous tools to achieve user-defined goals. While AutoGPT is still under development,
our work is the first to instantiate the idea and verify its effectiveness on well-studied benchmarks.

General Framework: Chameleon
To address the limitations of current LLMs in utilizing diverse tools, we propose Chameleon , a
novel plug-and-play compositional reasoning framework, synthesizing the composition of various
tools to accommodate a wide range of problems. Chameleon is comprised of a module inventory
that defines different types of tools and an LLM-based planner, whose purpose is to decompose
the original problem into sub-tasks that can be effectively solved by task-specific tools. Unlike
existing tool-augmented LLM approaches [47, 12, 55, 48], our module inventory features multiple
tool types as illustrated in Table 2, enabling Chameleon to exhibit various reasoning abilities,
