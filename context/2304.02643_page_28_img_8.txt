We have several models that, when provided with a click or a box as input, output a mask. We would
like to compare the quality of these models by rating the quality of their masks on many examples.
The interface will be different than for regular mask annotation.
•
Each job reviews one mask in one image.
•
On the right, there will be ﬁve image thumbnails in two rows. Each thumbnail can be moused-
over to show the image at a larger size. Clicking on the thumbnail will make it full screen, and
clicking again will return to the original screen.
–
The images show the same mask in ﬁve different views. On the top row: (left) the image
without the mask, (middle) the mask overlaid on the image, and (right) the mask alone. On
the bottom row: (left) a zoomed in view of the object without a mask, and (right) a zoomed
in view of the mask overlaid on the image. These views are provided to make it easy to see
different types of mask errors.
–
The mask will be in red when overlaid on the image.
–
When shown by itself, the mask is yellow, and the background is purple.
–
Each image will include either a blue dot or a blue and white box. This is the input to the
model, as if you had clicked at this location or drawn this box.
•
On the left, there are buttons labeled 1-10. This is used to rate the quality of the shown mask.
Objective and Setup
Example interface page. There will be ﬁve images on the
right and a question box on the left.
Mouse over an image to show the full image.
Click on an image to make it full screen. The arrows will cy-
cle between images. Click again to return to previous view.
The ﬁrst image on the top row shows the image without a
mask. A blue point will be on the object of interest, or a
blue and white box will surround it.
The second image on the top row shows the mask for the
object in red.
The third image on the top row shows the mask only. The
mask is in yellow and the background is purple.
The ﬁrst image on the bottom row shows a zoomed in view
of the object without a mask.
The second image on the bottom row shows a zoomed in
view of the object with a mask. The mask is in red.
On the left are buttons to rate the mask quality, with selec-
tions 1-10.
What we would like you to do for each job:
•
Please aim to spend up to 30 seconds per job.
•
Mouse-over or click each of the three images of the mask on the right to get a sense of the
quality of the mask. The thumbnail is too small to judge a mask, do not judge a mask by the
thumbnail alone. Each image can provide a different signal on possible mask errors:
–
The unzoomed image can give context for the mask: does this mask correspond to an actual
object?
–
The mask-only image can show if the mask has small holes or separated, incorrect pixels.
–
The zoomed image can show if the mask boundaries make sense.
•
Judge the quality of the mask on three criterion. Examples will follow.
–
Does the mask correspond to an actual object?
–
Does the mask have a good boundary?
–
Does the mask correspond to the provided point or box?
•
Rate the quality of the mask on a scale of 1-10 using the drop-down box on the left.
•
Next are details and examples for judging mask quality according to the three criterion. These
are just examples and other cases may come up, please use your best judgment when deter-
mining if something is a good mask.
Task
Does the mask correspond to an actual object?
•
Valid objects can include:
–
Entire single objects (such as a person, shirt, or tree)
–
Logical parts of objects (a chair leg, a car door, a tabletop)
–
Collections of objects (a stack of books, a crowd of people)
–
‘Stuff’ (the ground, the sky).
•
Example errors a mask may have. The severity of these errors may be minor or major:
–
Include a piece of another object (the mask of a person including the arm of a nearby
person)
–
Miss part of an object (the mask covers only one part of a building obscured by a tree in
the foreground),
–
Combine two unrelated things (a single mask covers both a mug and a pen on a desk)
–
Include an arbitrary part of a collection for a point input (a point is on one apple, but
the mask covers three apples in a pile of many apples). If a box surrounds an arbitrary
collection, it is not an error to provide a mask for these objects.
•
If you are unsure, a good rule-of-thumb is: can you name the object in question? However,
some things that are hard to name may still be good objects (an unusual component of a
machine, something at the edge of the image for which it is hard to determine what it is).
Judging Mask Quality (1 of 3)
Does the mask have a good boundary?
•
Errors in the boundary can include:
–
Incorrect holes in the mask
–
Incorrect pixels included separated from the main part of the mask
–
Poor edge quality, where the mask does not exactly match the edge of the object.
–
Failure to consistently handle obscuring foreground objects (a mask that covers obscuring
objects is ﬁne, and a mask that doesn’t cover obscuring objects is ﬁne, but one that does
some of both has an error)
–
Pixelation of a small mask is not an error, as long as the mask still matches the edges of
the object.
Judging Mask Quality (2 of 3)
Does the mask correspond to the provided point or box?
•
For points:
–
The point needs to be on the mask.
–
The size or position of the object with respect to the point does not matter (a point on
someone’s gloved hand can correspond to the glove or to the entire person, both are valid
masks).
•
For boxes:
–
The object needs to be the best object that is the size of the box (if a box is around some-
one’s entire head but the mask is of their hair, this is an error: their hair is in the box but is
not the correct object).
–
If the box clearly corresponds to a given object but is slightly smaller than it, it is okay if
the mask goes slightly outside a box (if a box around a person misses their extended hand,
the mask can still include their hand even if the mask goes outside the box).
Judging Mask Quality (3 of 3)
Example error of ‘Include a piece of another object’: The
elephant mask contains a piece of another nearby elephant.
Example error of ‘Missing a part of an object’: the mask is
missing a disconnected part of the object: the back half of
the zebra, and the right portion of the plate.
Example error of ‘Include an arbitrary part of a collection’:
In top top image, the point is on one orange rind, but the
mask covers two orange rinds. This is a mask error: the
mask covers an arbitrary number of objects in the collection,
and should either cover one orange rind or all of them. In
the bottom image, the box is around both vegetables. Since
this is the best match to the box, this is not a mask error.
Example error for ‘Incorrect holes in the mask’: This mask
has holes in the upper left and on the left sides (black ar-
rows). These holes are much easier to see on the ‘mask
only’ image.
Example error for ‘Incorrect pixels included separated from
the main part of the mask’: The ‘mask only’ view reveals a
few stray incorrect pixels on the clock face.
Example error for ‘Poor edge quality’: The mask has poor
edge quality, both along the edge of the umbrella, as well as
along the thin pole.
Figure 19: Here we provide the complete guidelines given to annotations for the human review of mask quality. Some images
been edited slightly and faces have been blurred to enable release. Best viewed with zoom (part 1 of 2).
