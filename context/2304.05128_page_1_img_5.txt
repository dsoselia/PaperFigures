can match or outperform baseline models that sample more than 10Ã— predictions. Our work indicates
that besides improving their ability to generate code from scratch, teaching large language models to
perform SELF-DEBUGGING without human guidance is another promising path to enhance coding
capability and reduce the sampling cost required to accomplish challenging tasks.

Figure 1: SELF-DEBUGGING for iterative debugging using a large language model. At each debug-
ging step, the model first generates new code, then the code is executed and the model explains the
code. The code explanation along with the execution results constitute the feedback message, based
on which the model infers the code correctness and then adds this message to the feedback. The
