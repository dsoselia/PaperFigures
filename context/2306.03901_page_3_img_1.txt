Input Processing. ChatDB generates a series of intermediate steps to manipulate the symbolic memory by utilizing
LLMs if responding to the user input requires the use of memory. Otherwise, we use LLMs directly to generate a reply.
Chain-of-Memory. ChatDB executes a series of intermediate memory operation steps to interact with symbolic memory.
ChatDB manipulates the symbolic memory in sequence according to a series of previously generated SQL statements,
including operations such as insert, update, select, delete, etc. The external database executes the corresponding SQL
statements, updates the database, and returns the results. It is worth noting that ChatDB decides whether to update
the memory operation step based on the results of previous SQL statements before executing this operation. ChatDB
executes the next step following the same procedure until all operations on the memory are completed.
Response Summary. ChatDB summarizes the final response to the user based on the results of a series of chain-of-
memory steps.
