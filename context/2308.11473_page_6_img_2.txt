Leveraging the diffusion prior empowers the generator to
closely track the discriminator’s updates at an accelerated
pace.
As a result, the discriminator can focus on learn-
ing higher-level distribution discrepancies without spending
time on mastering minute details. Consequently, both the
generator and discriminator update at significantly higher
speeds compared to traditional vanilla 3D GANs.

5.1. Implementation details
As our baseline method, we opt for the default config-
uration of text-to-3D in the Stable DreamFusion reposi-
tory [21]. This baseline approach embraces classical SDS
For our baseline method, complex prompts such as
avatars typically require approximately 20k steps to achieve
complete convergence, while simpler prompts like flow-
ers converge around 15k steps. To ensure a fair compari-
son, we train the baseline method for 25K steps (1.5 to 2.5
GPU hours) to guarantee the full convergence of the 3D
model. As for our method, we resume training from 10k
to 20k steps of the baseline method, varying based on the
complexity of the prompt. Following the resumption and
dataset generation steps, we proceed to initialize a discrim-
inator using the same architecture as EG3D, commencing
our Diffusion-GAN dual training strategy.
It is important to note that the entire refinement process
is iterative in nature. After enhancing the 3D model’s qual-i
