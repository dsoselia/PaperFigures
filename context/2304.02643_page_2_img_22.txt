Figure 2: Example images with overlaid masks from our newly introduced dataset, SA-1B. SA-1B contains 11M diverse,
high-resolution, licensed, and privacy protecting images and 1.1B high-quality segmentation masks. These masks were
annotated fully automatically by SAM, and as we verify by human ratings and numerous experiments, are of high quality and
diversity. We group images by number of masks per image for visualization (there are âˆ¼100 masks per image on average).
