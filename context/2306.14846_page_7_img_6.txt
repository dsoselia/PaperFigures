els across all the embodiments we studied.
We
also find that the larger capacity of ViNT leads to
improved generalization compared to the smaller
GNM model, especially on robots that do not ap-
pear in the training dataset (e.g., Go 1). Crucially, we also find that ViNT demonstrates positive
transfer for in-domain robots (Vizbot), greatly outperforming a specialist model trained on only the
target robot and setting, an emergent phenomenon not present in smaller models. This indicates that
the model generalizes between tasks to improve performance, a key property of a foundation model.
