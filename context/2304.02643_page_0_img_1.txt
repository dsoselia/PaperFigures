Segment Anything 1B (SA-1B):
Figure 1: We aim to build a foundation model for segmentation by introducing three interconnected components: a prompt-
able segmentation task, a segmentation model (SAM) that powers data annotation and enables zero-shot transfer to a range
of tasks via prompt engineering, and a data engine for collecting SA-1B, our dataset of over 1 billion masks.
