3. Method
In this section, we provide a detailed explanation of how we utilize GPT-4 to optimize the
control of HVAC devices. The entire pipeline is depicted in Figure 1, which consists of the following
components:
LLM. A pre-trained large language model is employed as the decision-maker. Given a prompt,
it generates corresponding actions. The prompt includes a description of the current state, simple
HVAC control instructions, demonstrations of relevant states, and more. Further details on the
prompt design will be discussed in the subsequent sections.
