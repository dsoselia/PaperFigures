2022) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023)), which have demonstrated impressive competencies in utilizing
tools (Bubeck et al., 2023), are closed-source with their inner mechanisms opaque. This limits the
democratization of AI technologies and the scope of community-driven innovation and development.
In this regard, we deem it urgent to empower open-source LLMs to skillfully master diverse APIs.
Although prior works have explored building instruction tuning data for tool use (Li et al., 2023a;
Patil et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023b), they fail to fully stimulate the tool-use
capabilities within LLMs and have inherent limitations: (1) limited APIs: they either fail to in-
volve real-world APIs (e.g., RESTAPI) (Patil et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023) or consider only a
small scope of APIs with poor diversity (Patil et al
2023; Xu et al
2023b; Li et al
2023a);
