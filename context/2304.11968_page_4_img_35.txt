Failed Cases
We here also analyze the failed cases, as shown in Figure 3. Overall, we notice that the failed cases
typically appear on the following two occasions. 1) Current VOS models are mostly designed for short
videos, which focus more on maintaining short-term memory rather than long-term memory. This
leads to mask shrinkage or lacking reﬁnement in long-term videos, as shown in seq (a). Essentially,
we aim to solve them in step 3 by the reﬁnement ability of SAM, while its effectiveness is lower than
expected in realistic applications. It indicates that the ability of SAM reﬁnement based on multiple
prompts can be further improved in the future. On the other hand, human participation/interaction in
TAM can be an approach to solving such difﬁculties, while too much interaction will also result in
low efﬁciency. Thus, the mechanism of long-term memory preserving and transient memory updating
is still important. 2) When the object structure is complex, e.g., the bicycle wheels in seq (b) contain
many cavities in groundtruth masks. We found it very difﬁcult to get a ﬁne-grained initialized mask
by propagating the clicks. Thus, the coarse initialized masks may have side effects on the subsequent
frames and lead to poor predictions. This also inspires us that SAM is still struggling with complex
and precision structures.
