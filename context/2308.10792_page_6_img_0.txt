The tree state machine managed and tracked
the state (e.g., initial state, growing state, end
state) throughout the conversation crafting process.
Subsequently, the OpenAssistant Conversations
dataset was built by filtering out offensive and
p y
user and the AI assistant in turns and generates
messages in a conversational format. Specifically,
the authors first crafted a task template that defines
the roles and tasks for ChatGPT (as shown in
Table 3).
Next, they sampled questions (e.g.,
"How do you fix a Google Play Store account
that isnâ€™t working?") from Quora and Stack
Overflow datasets as conversation seeds (e.g.,
topics). Subsequently, they prompted ChatGPT
with the template and the sampled seed. ChatGPT
continuously generates messages for both sides
until a natural stopping point is reached.
