and between modules to convert the design into functional code. As illustrated in Figure 5, the architect also creates a
sequence flow diagram based on the system interface design, depicting the processes, objects involved, and the sequence
of messages exchanged between them required to carry out the functionality. As mentioned, these supplementary details
make collaborations easier, especially for engineers and project managers who are responsible for detailing the code
design.
Hence, the consistent, synergistic outputs of the architect roles are crucial for improving code quality by simplifying
the engineerâ€™s task of translating specifications into functional code. They reduce ambiguity, misinterpretations, and
confusion that can arise from freeform natural language.
In conclusion, the design and implementation of standardized outputs in MetaGPT offer a powerful tool for handling
complex tasks. The conversion of complex tasks, as defined in natural language, into standardized outputs promotes
collaborative consistency, thereby reducing the need for excessive dialogue turns that could result in incoherence.
Furthermore, it can clearly and consistently represent structural information, which can be challenging to convey
unambiguously through natural language alone, especially for LLM-based agents. By providing these structured and
standardized outputs, different agents gain a clear and aligned understanding of their tasks and responsibilities. This
approach not only streamlines communication but also enhances the ability of LLM-based multi-agent systems to
administer and execute complex tasks more effectively.
