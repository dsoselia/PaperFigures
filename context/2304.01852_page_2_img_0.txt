Figure 1: The graphical representation is utilized to depict the number of research articles related to ChatGPT published
from 2022 to April, 2023, revealing the trend and growth of ChatGPT-related research over time. The graph showcases
the monthly count of submissions and cumulative daily submitted count in arXiv. Over time, there has been an increasing
amount of research related to ChatGPT.
The open release of the multi-modal GPT-4 model further expands the horizon of large language models and empowers
exciting developments that involve diverse data beyond text.
The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of the existing research on ChatGPT and its potential
applications in various fields. To achieve this goal, we conducted a thorough analysis of papers related to ChatGPT
in the arXiv repository. As of April 1st, 2023, there are a total of 194 papers mentioning ChatGPT on arXiv. In this
study, we conducted a trend analysis of these papers and generated a word cloud to visualize the commonly used terms.
Additionally, we also examined the distribution of the papers across various fields and presented the corresponding
statistics. Figure 1 displays the submission trend of papers related to ChatGPT, indicating a growing interest in this
field. Figure 2 illustrates the word cloud analysis of all the papers. We can observe that the current research is primarily
focused on natural language processing, but there is still significant potential for research in other fields such as
education, medical and history. This is further supported by Figure 3, which displays the distribution of submitted
papers across various fields, highlighting the need for more research and development in these areas. Due to the rapid
advancement in research related to ChatGPT, we have also introduced a dynamic webpage that provides real-time
updates on the latest trends in these area. Interested readers can access the webpage and stay informed about the
evolving research directions by following this link 1.
This paper aims to shed light on the promising capabilities of ChatGPT and provide insight into its potential
impact in the future, including ethical considerations. Through this survey, we hope to provide insights into how these
models can be improved and extended in the future. In section 2, we will review the existing work related to ChatGPT,
including its applications and ethical considerations. In section 3, we conducted a review of existing literature that
assesses the capabilities of ChatGPT. We comprehensively evaluated the performance of ChatGPT based on these
studies. In addition to discussing the current state of research related to ChatGPT, we will also explore its limitations
in section 4. Furthermore, we will provide guidance on future directions for language model development.
