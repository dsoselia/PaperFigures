Figure 6 how Dino without the head orientation component is unable to correctly move its head
in the same way as the user. As shown in the supplementary video, both Oppy and Dino without
head orientation reward component show the head wobbling left and right while walking. These
characters have heavy heads needing learned control.

DISCUSSION
We discuss different capabilities and components of our system.
5.1
Physics-based control
Physics acts as a powerful helper in driving the motion of components with missing pose informa-
tion, with the skeleton description as underlying prior. For the tail of Dino, the simulator affords
several stylization options, i.e., whether we allow more joint mobility and passively actuate it
through a PD controller with fixed-set input as secondary motion or we let the policy make active
control decisions. In Figure 8 we show three examples, in which Dinoâ€™s tail is fixed, passively
actuated, or controlled by the learned policy. Tail and ears of Oppy are all treated as secondary
dynamics. This stylization would not be possible in a kinematic retargeting setting.
5.2
Controlling the style
Our method is robust to different set of parameters. Once changed, most parameters still output
a reasonable motion controller with different styles. As described in subsection 4.3, the contact
