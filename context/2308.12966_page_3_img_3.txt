Inputs and Outputs
Image Input: Images are processed through the visual encoder and adapter, yielding fixed-length sequences
of image features. To differentiate between image feature input and text feature input, two special tokens
(<img> and </img>) are appended to the beginning and end of the image feature sequence respectively,
signifying the start and end of image content.
