Performance.
This measure compares the effectiveness of each approach in different
scenarios relative to existing algorithms.
• Interpretability. This element examines the level of interpretability achievable by each
approach. For instance, by providing LLMs with appropriate prompts, the LLM-based
approach can produce not only final actions but also the reasoning process, making the re-
sults more comprehensible to humans. This is not the case for approaches that incorporate
deep neural networks, as their outputs are typically difficult to interpret.
• LLMs Accessibility. This consideration explores whether an approach requires the access
to the weights or only the API of the LLM.
We present the results in Table 7 where more “+”s indicate a better capability on the corre-
sponding aspect. Let us inspect the results row by row.
